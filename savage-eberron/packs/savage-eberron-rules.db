In this chapter we show you how to make basic skill and attribute checks—and make your combats Fast, Furious, and Fun!</p><h2>Wild Cards &amp; Extras</h2><p>Your hero (a player character), and unique allies, villains, and monsters are collectively called “Wild Cards.” These beings have a better chance at doing things, are a little tougher to put down, and are generally more detailed than common guards, minions, or lackeys—collectively called “Extras.”</p><p>Wild Cards are noted with a design of some sort before their name.</p><h3 class=\"dragon-icon\">Goblin Warchanter</h3><p>In <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> the Wild Card symbol is a distinctive dragon head.</p><p>Player characters are always Wild Cards. The Dungeon Master must decide which of her nonplayer characters and monsters are Wild Cards. The sergeant of the City Watch probably isn’t a Wild Card, but Sergeant Grimlock of the City Watch may be. Skytch the Dragon is also a Wild Card, though his three young wyrms aren’t.</p><p>Wild Cards are those who have stepped up to do more than most. They dare, aspire, and risk it all to be a hero—or a villain!</p><p>They have two special abilities in the game:</p><ul><li>Wild Cards can take three @UUID[JournalEntry.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#damage-effects]{Wounds} before they’re @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Incapacitation]{Incapacitated}.</li><li>Wild Cards roll a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die} (usually a d6) along with their skill or attribute die when making @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait rolls} and take the highest of the two as their total.</li></ul><h2>Trait Rolls</h2><p>To make a skill or attribute “check” or “roll,” simply roll the die assigned to it. If the result is a 4 or better (the “Target Number” or TN), the action is successful. For example, if a character’s Strength is a d6, he rolls a six-sided die. On a 4 or better, he’s successful.</p><p><strong>Modifiers:</strong> Circumstances modify the die roll, such as shooting at something far away or finding a well-hidden clue. Some things, such as ranged attacks, have standard modifiers. It’s up to the DM to determine any modifiers for more subjective tasks, such as spotting an ambush or eavesdropping on a conversation through a door.</p><p>In general, an easy task, such as finding tracks in the mud, is made at +2. A difficult task, such as finding tracks by torchlight, is made at −2. A very difficult task, such as finding tracks in a rainstorm, is made at −4.</p><p><strong>Multiple Dice:</strong> When a character rolls multiple dice, such as when firing two arrows with the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Rapid Shot]{Rapid Shot} Edge, check each die separately.</p><h3>Wild Die</h3><p>Extras roll a single die when making a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait roll}. @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Cards} roll an extra d6 and take the highest of their Trait die or the “Wild Die.” Both of these dice can Ace (see below).</p><p><strong>One Wild Die Per Action:</strong> When Wild Cards roll multiple dice for a single action, they roll only one Wild Die. It may replace a Trait die or be ignored—it never adds another action or attack to the roll.</p><p class=\"example\"><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> A fighter has the <em><strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Frenzy]{Frenzy}</strong></em> Edge. He rolls an extra Fighting die when making a melee attack along with a Wild Die. Only two of his dice can cause hits since the Wild Die can only replace a die, not add another attack.</p><h3>Aces</h3><p>All @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Trait} and damage rolls in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> are open-ended. That means that when you roll the highest number possible on a die (a 6 on a d6, an 8 on a d8, and so on), you get to roll that die again and add it to the total. This is called an “Ace.” Any modifiers to the die roll should be tacked on after adding up an Aced roll.</p><p class=\"example\"><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> A rogue attempts to leap a dangerous ice chasm. She’s a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} with a d8 in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}, so she rolls a d8 and a d6 and takes the highest result. In this case, both dice Ace (8 on the d8 and 6 on the d6). She rolls the d8 again and gets a 4 for a total of 12 on the d8. She rolls the d6 again and gets another 6, followed by a 2—that’s a total of 14 on the Wild Die. The wily rogue leaps the chasm with ease!</p><h3>Raises</h3><p>Sometimes it’s important to know just how successful a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait roll} was. Every 4 points over the Target Number is called a “raise.” If your hero needs a 4 to shoot an opponent and rolls an 11, he hits with a raise. Figure raises after adjusting for any modifiers.</p><p>A raise always provides an additional effect of some sort, such as bonus damage when attacking or a benefit determined by the DM for other rolls.</p><h3>Opposed Rolls</h3><p>Sometimes rolls are “opposed” by an opponent. The attacker gets a @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Trait} total, then the defender attempts to beat it.</p><p>The exact skills or attributes used in a contest are specified in each circumstance, or the DM can decide what makes the most sense. If two characters try to pull something from each other’s hands, for example, they make opposed Strength rolls. Sneaking up on someone is a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth} roll opposed by @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}.</p><p>The acting character in an opposed roll always makes the Trait total first (including spending any <strong>@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies}</strong>), and must get at least a basic success (TN 4) or he fails. The defender rolls next and must <em>meet</em> or <em>exceed</em> the first character’s result or the attacker wins.</p><p>The winner also uses the opponent’s total for purposes of determining raise effects.</p><h3>Critical Failures</h3><p>A Critical Failure occurs when a Wild Card rolls a 1 on both the skill die and Wild Die of a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait roll}. The attempt automatically fails and something bad happens—a weapon is dropped or gets stuck, the attack hits a friend, the vehicle crashes, spells misfire (see <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Backlash]{Backlash}</strong>), and so on.</p><p>Critical Failures cannot be rerolled by any means, even with <strong>@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies}</strong>.</p><p><strong>Extras and Critical Failures:</strong> If an Extra rolls a 1 on a Trait check <em>and it’s important to know if it’s a Critical Failure</em>, such as when casting a spell, roll a d6. On a 1, it’s a Critical Failure. Otherwise it’s just a normal failure.</p><p><strong>Multiple Dice:</strong> Some abilities allow characters to roll multiple Trait dice, such as the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Frenzy]{Frenzy} Edge or firing a weapon with a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Rate of Fire]{Rate of Fire} higher than 1. A Critical Failure with multiple dice occurs when more than half the die results are a natural 1. If the character is a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}, the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die} <em>must</em> be a 1 as well.</p><p class=\"example\"><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> A fighter with the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Frenzy]{Frenzy} Edge rolls two @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} dice and one @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die}. If two or more of the dice come up 1s, including the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die}, it’s a Critical Failure.</p><h3>Unskilled Attempts</h3><p>If a character doesn’t have a skill for an action he’s attempting, he rolls a d4 for his skill die (and a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die} if a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}) and subtracts 2 from the total.</p><p>The DM may decide certain tasks cannot be attempted unskilled, such as repairing a steam engine or piloting an airship.</p><h3>Reroll</h3><p>Some Edges or abilities allow a character to reroll @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Trait} (as long as they’re not a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure}). To do so, roll <em>all</em> the dice again and get a new total. You may keep any set you like <em>unless</em> you roll a Critical Failure. This ends all rerolls immediately and becomes the result of the attempt—that’s the risk one takes in pushing the limits!</p><p>Multiple rerolls may be granted from different @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edges}, @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies}, or other abilities.</p><h3>Group Rolls</h3><p>When the DM wants to make a Trait roll for a group of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Extras} with like @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Traits}, roll one Trait die as usual along with a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die} and treat this as the group’s result. This gives a decent average without making rolls for every individual.</p><p class=\"example\"><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> A group of soldiers attempts to pass by an enemy encampment. The DM rolls their @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth} die (a d6) and a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die} and takes the best of the two as the soldiers’ total.</p><h2>Bennies</h2><p>Every now and then, dice rolls may not work in your favor. That’s why <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> gives players a little control over their hero’s fate.</p><h3>Player Character Bennies</h3><p>Players start each game session with three “@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies}” (American slang for “benefits”), represented by poker chips, gaming stones, the official @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies} we make for all of our games, or other tokens that signify a little bit of good luck or fate. @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies} are discarded at the end of each session—use them or lose them!</p><p><strong>Combat:</strong> If a session ends in the middle of combat or other dramatic event, wait until it’s resolved in the next session before giving out new @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies}.</p><p><strong>GM Rewards:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies} are earned during the game in two ways:</p><ul><li><p><span class=\"list-heading\">Awards:</span> The Dungeon Master should occasionally reward players for clever actions, roleplaying their character (especially any Hindrances), or great feats of heroism.<br />She can also award players a Benny for telling a great story in character, delivering a fantastic line that makes everyone laugh, or creating an emotional moment.</p></li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Joker’s Wild:</span> When a player character draws a Joker during combat, <em>all</em> player characters receive a Benny! If the players get both Jokers everyone gets <em>two</em> Bennies!</li></ul><h3>Dungeon Master Bennies</h3><p>Dungeon Masters start each session with a pool of one Benny per player character. These may be used by any of her characters (including non-Wild Cards!).</p><p>The DM's Wild Cards also have Bennies of their own, a base of three modified by their Edges and Hindrances. They can use these or any of the Bennies in the common pool as the DM wishes.</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Joker’s Wild:</span> Anytime the villains draw a Joker, put one Benny in their general pool and give another to each enemy @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}.</li></ul><h3>Using Bennies</h3><p>Bennies may be spent at any appropriate time and don’t incur any sort of penalty. They may only be used for your own character.</p><p>Here are the ways players can use Bennies.</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Reroll a Trait:</span> Bennies grant a hero a reroll on <em>any</em> Trait (see <strong>Rerolls,</strong> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Reroll]{here}).</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Recover from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shaken]{Shaken}:</span> This is instant and may be done at any time, even interrupting another’s actions if desired.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Recover Power Points:</span> A character with an Arcane Background, Mystic Powers, or any other ability that grants @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Points} can spend a Benny as a free action to recover five Power Points.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Soak Rolls:</span> Bennies can be used to prevent @UUID[JournalEntry.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#damage-effects]{Wounds} or recover from being Shaken.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Draw a New @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#action-cards-(initiative)]{Action Card}:</span> When the game is in rounds, a character can spend a Benny to get a new <strong>@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#action-cards-(initiative)]{Action Cards}</strong>. This occurs after all cards are dealt and Edges or Hindrances like @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Quick]{Quick}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Level Headed]{Level Headed}, or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Hesitant]{Hesitant} are resolved. <em>Then</em> players or the DM may spend Bennies for an additional card as many times as they like and take their choice of all their draws. Edges like Quick or Level Headed <em>do not</em> apply to these additional cards drawn with Bennies. This continues until everyone (including the GM) passes. Then the round begins and no further cards may be drawn.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Reroll Damage:</span> You may spend a Benny to reroll damage. Include any additional dice you may have gained for a raise on the attack roll.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Influence the Story:</span> This one is entirely up to the Dungeon Master, who may allow a character to spend a Benny to find an additional clue if you’re stuck, come up with some mundane but needed item, or push a nonplayer character into being a bit more agreeable.</li></ul><p class=\"example\"><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> The party is adrift on a storm-tossed sea. None of the characters purchased navigational equipment, but Harsk the ranger had been aiding their doomed captain through the previous encounters. Harsk's player asks the Dungeon Master if he might have been given his own compass and maps while aiding the captain, and might still have them in his bag. The DM agrees—for a @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Benny}. Harsk suddenly remembers the tools in his pack and turns the boat toward shore.</p><p> </p><aside class=\"sidebar\"><h2>Awarding Bennies</h2><p>It takes a few games to figure out how many @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies} you should award players during a session. In general, we recommend you be fairly free with them, especially early in the game. If someone makes everyone laugh (and isn’t distracting the flow of the game), toss the player a Benny. When players roleplay a Hindrance, reward them. When someone does something clever or heroic or imaginative, acknowledge it with a Benny.</p><p>Some GMs worry the game will become too easy if Bennies are too common, but we find the opposite is true. When Bennies are plentiful, players often spend them on trivial things that are important to <em>them</em>. Maybe the rogue <em>really</em> wants to pick the lock on a chest. There’s nothing particularly valuable inside and the player probably knows it, but the character is the <em>rogue</em> and wants to prove it to the rest of the party.</p><p>When Bennies are scarce, however, players tend to save them for injuries, death, or taking out the big bads. That’s fine, but takes away from the fun and heroics that got them to this point. <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is about big action and players should be encouraged to take chances. The “currency” of these chances are those Bennies.</p><p>Veteran <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> GMs might also notice Bennies tend to flow fairly fast early on in a session. The group is settling in, laughing, and are rewarded for roleplaying their Hindrances the first time or two. In the mid-to-late game, Bennies tend to be spent faster than they’re gained. That’s a fantastic pace. It gives the heroes opportunities to do big things in the early and mid-game then forces some critical resource management for the final showdown.</p><p>If you find yourself being stingy, go the other way the next time you run and see how it affects your group. Then you’ll know what’s right for you and your friends.</p></aside><h2>Conviction</h2><p>Conviction is a special award granted when a character experiences a great and meaningful victory; or a painful and catastrophic misfortune. Either drives the hero to increase her efforts, giving her inner strength she can draw on in the most desperate situations.</p><p>Like @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies}, players should receive a physical token of some sort to note their Conviction. The tokens can be spent at any time to add a d6 to all the character’s Trait and damage totals until the beginning of her next turn. This die can @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aces]{Ace}, and its result is added to the final total.</p><div><img style=\"padding:1%\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/general/sorrowful-regret.webp\" /></div><p>Conviction tokens don't stack, but the bonus may be maintained from round to round by spending a Benny at the start of the character's turn. Once Conviction lapses, however, the effect ends.</p><p>Conviction tokens aren’t Bennies and can’t be used as such. They <em>are</em> kept between sessions, however, and a hero can have more than one Conviction token at a time.</p><p><strong>Refresh:</strong> A hero may also spend Conviction to trigger or refresh abilities that are usually only usable once per session, day, encounter, and so on, even if they’ve already been used.</p><h2 class=\"example\">Example: Tragedy &amp; Triumph</h2><p>Seelah the paladin of Iomedae and her companions signed on to escort a caravan from Turtleback Ferry to Sandpoint. Over the course of the journey, they made friends with the caravanners. Seelah became particularly close with a young girl she thought of as a daughter, Julia.</p><p>Then tragedy struck. A savage and brutal band of ogres descended from the hills and attacked the caravan. Seelah and her friends tore into the ogres with savage ferocity, but when the dust settled, Julia was found dead.</p><p>Given her close relationship with the girl, the Dungeon Master decides Seelah's player gains @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Conviction]{Conviction}. The paladin burns with rage at the murderous ogres and chastises herself for failing to protect her friend.</p><p>Later on, the party corners the ogres' chief in his hilltop fortress. Seelah personally defeats the brute in single combat and avenges Julia's death. The Dungeon Master decides the paladin's triumph is also worthy of Conviction.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Combat","type":"text","_id":"5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\"><div><h1 class=\"wide\">Combat</h1></div><p>Whether they’re the burning plains of the Cinderlands or the cursed battlefield of the Plain of Ten Thousand Swords—these are <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> and they are often violent.</p><p>The rest of this chapter tells you how great heroes and terrible monsters battle in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>. The combat rules are designed for use with miniatures or pawns by default, but it’s easy to use these concepts when you’re playing without them.</p><p><strong>Distance:</strong> Because the game assumes you are using terrain or a battlemat and standard 28mm miniatures, movement and weapon ranges are listed in inches. To translate that to regular distance, one inch equals two yards.</p><p>If you’re using miniatures and need to accommodate a larger battlefield, simply set each inch as five or 10 yards, for example, and adjust movement and ranges appropriately.</p><p><strong>Time:</strong> When a fight breaks out, game time breaks down into rounds of about six seconds each. Ten rounds equal one minute.</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Round:</span> A “round” is an entire countdown of @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#action-cards-(initiative)]{Action Cards}, from the Ace to the Deuce (Two).</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Turn:</span> A character’s “turn” occurs when his Action Card comes up in the countdown. A hero with the Six of Diamonds, for example, takes his turn when that card comes up in the round.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Action:</span> A single attack, skill use, etc. Characters may perform multiple actions on their turn (see <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Multi-Actions]{Multi-Actions}</strong>).</li></ul><h2>Action Cards (Initiative)</h2><p>The action in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is fast and furious. To help the Dungeon Master keep track of who goes in what order and add a little randomness to the game, we use a single deck of playing cards with both Jokers left in to determine everyone’s initiative order. We call these “Action Cards.”</p><p>The DM can deal cards face up or face down as she sees fit. She might also deal the players’ cards face up and the villains face down to increase the players’ tension and uncertainty!</p><p>At the start of each round:</p><ul><li>Deal each @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} an Action Card (plus any extra cards for @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edges}). @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Allies]{Allies} under a player’s control act on his Action Card.</li><li>Groups of nonplayer characters and creatures, such as all @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Zombie, Human]{zombies}, all @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Dog/wolf]{wolves}, and so on, should share an Action Card so they act together. This breaks each group up a bit for dramatic purposes and game balance and keeps things easy for the Dungeon Master to manage.</li></ul><p><strong>Shuffle:</strong> Shuffle the deck after any round in which a Joker was dealt.</p><p><strong>Large Groups:</strong> In very large groups or time-sensitive games, the Dungeon Master can deal a single card per side (heroes and villains). On the heroes’ turn, simply start at one end of the group and work quickly around. This speeds things up if that’s more important than varying initiative order. If one or more characters have @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Level Headed]{Level Headed} or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Quick]{Quick}, let that apply to the draw (but only once).</p><h2>Actions</h2><p>Characters perform “actions” when their @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#action-cards-(initiative)]{Action Card} comes up each round. This is their “turn.” A character can move (see <strong>@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#movement]{Movement}</strong>, below) and perform one regular action at any point in her movement, attacking, casting a spell, and so on, without penalty.</p><p>Characters can choose from a multitude of actions on their turn. Common actions include @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Supporting} allies, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Test]{Testing} foes, using a power, or attacking with @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting}. See <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Multi-Actions]{Multi-Actions}</strong> to perform more than one action per turn (though only one of these can be a limited action).</p><p>More complex actions like lighting a torch or digging through a backpack might require more than a round to complete (DM's call).</p><h2>Movement</h2><p>Characters can move a number of tabletop inches equal to their Pace each turn, and may freely set their facing as they do so.</p><p>Each inch of movement spent climbing, crawling, or swimming uses 2″ of Pace.</p><p><strong>Running:</strong> A hero can “run” as a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Free Actions]{free action} once per turn, increasing her Pace for the round by her running die (a d6 by default) at the cost of a −2 penalty to all other actions that turn. Running dice never @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aces]{Ace}. (The running die is random to account for nuances of terrain not depicted on the tabletop and for the “risk to reward” decision players must make.)</p><p>Out of combat situations, a character can move twice the sum of her full Pace + maximum running die for a number of minutes equal to half her Vigor die type. Thus a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Fleet-Footed]{Fleet-Footed} character with Vigor d6 can sprint at a Pace of 32 for three minutes.</p><p><strong>Difficult Ground:</strong> Each inch a hero moves over rough terrain such as thick forest, up or down a steep incline, slippery ice, etc., counts as 2″ of her Pace. Crawling is unaffected by Difficult Ground.</p><p><strong>Hazards:</strong> If the DM feels movement is hazardous for some reason—climbing under duress, swimming a fast-moving river, walking a tightrope—she can require an @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} roll to move. Success means she continues on normally. Failure means she can’t move. With a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} the character takes @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} from <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps and Bruises}</strong>, falls if climbing or in a precarious position (see <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Falling]{Falling}</strong>), or drowns if swimming (see <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Drowning]{Drowning}</strong>) both in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Hazards]{Hazards}.</p><h2>Attacks</h2><p>The basics of fast, furious combat are discussed in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Melee Attacks]{Melee Attacks} and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Ranged Attacks]{Ranged Attacks}. Many additional options and situations are covered under <strong>Situational Rules</strong> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Situational Rules]{here}.</p><h2>Damage</h2><p>After a successful melee or ranged hit, the attacker rolls damage. Ranged weapons do fixed damage as listed in the @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.QKA6dagfLDYyCUh6.JournalEntryPage.kYcSTPeASQ45iHrC]{Gear} section. Most bows, for example, cause 2d6 damage.</p><p>Hand weapons cause damage equal to the attacker’s @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Strength} die plus a second die, which depends on the weapon. A barbarian with a d12 Strength and a long sword (d8 damage) rolls d12+d8 damage. Add the rolls on the damage dice together to get the damage total.</p><p>Even though Strength is used to determine melee damage, this isn’t a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait roll} so @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Cards} don’t add a Wild Die to the roll.</p><p>All damage rolls can @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aces]{Ace}.</p><p><strong>Unarmed Damage:</strong> An unarmed combatant rolls only his @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Strength} die unless he has an @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edge} like <strong>\"@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Brawler]{Brawler}</strong> that grants him a damage die.</p><h2>Damage Effects</h2><p>Damage can result in three effects: Shaken, Woounds, and Incapacitation.</p><h3>Shaken</h3><p>Shaken characters are nicked, bruised, or otherwise rattled. They may only take free actions, such as moving (including running). At the start of their turn, Shaken characters must attempt to recover from being Shaken by making a Spirit roll. This is a free action.</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Failure:</span> The character remains Shaken. She can only perform free actions.</li><li>Success: The character is no longer Shaken and may act normally.</li></ul><p><strong>Bennies:</strong> A player may spend a Benny at any time to remove her Shaken status (even when it’s not her turn).</p><h3>Wounds</h3><p>Every raise on the damage roll inflicts a Wound. Extras are Incapacitated if they take a single Wound (and aren’t <strong>Resilient</strong>). They’re dead, injured, or otherwise out of the fight.</p><p>Wild Cards can take three Wounds and still function (more with certain Edges or abilities). Further damage doesn’t cause additional Wounds but Incapacitates them instead.</p><p><strong>Wound Penalties:</strong> Each Wound a character suffers causes a −1 cumulative penalty to his Pace (minimum of 1″) and all Trait rolls--up to a maximum penalty of −3.</p><p><strong>Timing:</strong> Characters sometimes take multi­ple hits on the same Action Card. Resolve each damage roll separately before moving on to the next (including any Soak rolls).</p><h3>Wound Cap</h3><p>In <cite>Savage Pathfinder</cite>, characters can never suffer more than four Wounds in a single hit and therefore never have to Soak more than four wounds either. This rule keeps combat dangerous but reduces the chances of heroes (and villains!) dying from a single lucky blow. It can still happen, but it is far more rare.</p><p>Ignore the cap for catastrophic damage such as falls from great heights, extreme environments such as lava, and so on.</p><p><strong>Large Creatures:</strong> The Wound Cap still applies to large or Resilient creatures with more than three Wounds. A Huge dragon that can take five Wounds before being @UUID[Compendium.swpf-core-rules.swpf-rules.swpfcore03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03combat00000000]{Incapacitated}, for example, can’t take more than four from a single attack, so it can’t be killed with a single attack even if it fails to Soak.</p><h3>Incapacitation</h3><p>Incapacitated characters may not perform actions but are still dealt Action Cards for the remainder of the encounter in case they recover or must roll for other effects such as <strong>Bleeding Out</strong> (below). Edges or Hindrances that affect card draws, such as Quick, Level Headed, or Hesitant are ignored when the hero is Incapacitated.</p><p>If Incapacitated by damage or injury, he must make an immediate Vigor roll:</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Critical Failure:</span> The character dies.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Failure:</span> Roll on the <strong>Injury Table</strong>. The Injury is permanent and the character is <strong>Bleeding Out</strong>, see Bleeding Out below.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Success:</span> Roll on the <strong>Injury Table</strong>. The Injury goes away when all Wounds are healed.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Raise:</span> Roll on the <strong>Injury Table</strong>. The Injury goes away in 24 hours, or when all Wounds are healed (whichever is sooner).</li></ul><p>Characters cannot take actions of any kind and might be unconscious (GM’s call). The victim makes a Vigor roll each day thereafter and is no longer Incapacitated(or unconscious) if successful. They may also heal Wounds during this time (see <strong>Natural Healing</strong>).</p><p><strong>Bleeding Out:</strong> The injured character is dying and must make a Vigor roll at the start of his turn. Failure means he perishes. With success he survives but must roll again next turn (or every minute if not in combat). With a raise, he stabilizes and no further rolls are required.</p><p>Other characters may stop a victim’s bleeding by making a Healing roll (the @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Healing]{Healing}{skill} or the spell). This is an action, and if successful the patient is stabilized.</p><p>The <em>@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Healing]{Healing}{healing}</em> power can also stabilize Wounds, as can a successful “natural” healing roll by a being with regeneration of some sort.</p><p><strong>Incapacitation from @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.OPSttc2CAS2LC1ju.JournalEntryPage.7LJ6PoYcYzg4lThm]{Fatigue}</strong></p><aside class=\"sidebar\"><h2>More on Shaken</h2><p>Figuring out how Shaken and Wounds work together takes a little getting used to, but is worth it for the game play it provides. In essence, it means Shaking an Extra twice usually takes it off the table. It gets a bit more complicated with Wild Card or creatures that can take more than one Wound, so here’s a table that might help.</p><h3><span class=\"red-label\">Examples:</span></h3><ul><li>A character takes a Wound.

Raising a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point.</p><p><strong>Attribute Limit:</strong> No attribute may be raised above a d12 unless an ancestral ability or @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edge} says otherwise. Each increase beyond a d12 adds a +1 modifier. Increasing a d12 Strength two steps or “die types,” for example, gives your hero a @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Strength} score of d12+2.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Skills are learned abilities such as firing weapons, hand-to-hand combat, scientific knowledge, professional aptitudes, and so on.</p><p>Skills in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> are very broad to keep the action simple and straightforward. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} skill, for example, covers all types of bows and crossbows. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} skill covers thrown weapons, as well as grappling, swimming, and climbing. Detailed customization comes in the form of @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edges}.</p><p><strong>Core Skills:</strong> Five skills are marked with a red star in the list for skills in @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Traits}: <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}</strong>, and <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}</strong>.

If you exceed the linked attribute, the cost becomes 2 points per die type.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Your character starts with Common and knows additional languages equal to half her @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Smarts} die type.

Standard Pace is 6, which means six tabletop inches per game round. Each inch is two yards (6 feet) in the real world. <strong>@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#movement]{Movement}</strong> is explained in detail in @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe]{Combat}.</p><p><strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry}</strong> is equal to 2 plus half your character’s @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} die type (a total of 2 if a character doesn’t have Fighting), plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. This is the Target Number (TN) to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>For Fighting skills higher than d12, such as d12+1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded down. For instance, Fighting d12+1 grants a Parry of 8, while Fighting d12+2 results in a Parry of 9.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> A hero’s default @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} is 0 unless altered by ancestral abilities, @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edges}, or @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.71p7h2rERyAUfpmt]{Hindrances}.

There’s no point in being the party’s healer if that’s not a role you care to play.</p><h3>Deities and alignment</h3><p>The conflict between Good and Evil is a core theme of any <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> game. Typically, heroes fight for Good, but not always.</p><p>Alignments in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> indicate the general moral compass of a person, creature or organization. Where alignment is listed, it is a tool for the Dungeon Master to identify the broad outlook of that entity, and how it may interact with others, including the adventurers. When choosing an alignment for your character, you decide what ethical path he will follow, guided by the @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edges} and @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.71p7h2rERyAUfpmt]{Hindrances} you chose to define him. Unless your DM specifically agrees, you cannot choose Evil as your alignment.</p><p>Some character concepts require choosing a deity or “Domain” that governs powers and certain abilities. Likewise, the player’s choice of Hindrances can involve a Deity or a cause, such as @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Vow]{Vow} or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Code of Honor]{Code of Honor}. Deities have a listed alignment, either Good, Neutral, or Evil to indicate the general philosophy of the deity and her followers. Of course, adherents to a particular faith might not necessarily share the same outlook as the deity's alignment. Terrible deeds might be perpetrated in the name of a good or merciful god. You can find more information on domains and deities in the @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edges} section.</p></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"ZGzSJDQJ4G0PdLnd","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":100000,"name":"Species","type":"text","_id":"WlhfcDVcVAW85lfa","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"swpf-core\"><h1 class=\"wide\">Species</h1><p><cite>Savage Eberron </cite>includes nineteen recommended species for use in character creation, along with abilities that reflect the most common or iconic virtues and drawbacks of each.</p><p>Note that the following descriptions allude to a lot of rules we haven’t explained yet.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Known as <em>guul'dar</em>, or \"strong people\", among the <em>dar</em> or goblin races. <em>Guul'dar</em> are born for battle and mayhem being fierce and aggressive. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despite being bossed around. In Darguun they living in tribes in the Marguul mountains, or in the <em>ghaal'dur </em>tribes ruling Darguun often serving as shock troops being ruled by the hobgoblins with superior numbers and intellect.</p><h3>The Marguul</h3><p>The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the <em>ghaal'dar</em> long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.</p><p>As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Bloodthirsty]{Bloodthirsty}:</span> Bugbears are very brutal killers and like to inflict pain. </li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Brute Strength:</span> Bugbears are naturally strong, and start with a d6 in @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Strength} instead of a d4.

Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression. It's also an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.</p><h3>A Hidden People</h3><p>Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether their presence is known.</p><p>Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler.</p><p>In creating a changeling adventurer, consider the character's relationships with people around them. Does the character conceal their true changeling nature? Do they embrace it? Do they have connections to other changelings or are they alone and in search of companions?</p><h3>Masks and Personas</h3><p>In their true form, changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shapeone created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history-is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona with a history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p><p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on dutywill adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Change Appearance]{Change Appearance}:</span> Changelings can alter physical appearance at will as per the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Disguise]{disguise}</em> power except it cannot affect clothing or gear.

Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.</p><p>Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm belowwhich was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten. </p><h3>Dwarves of the Mror Holds</h3><p>The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions-strange symbiotic items that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.</p><p>Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element ofyour character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.</p><p>Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.</p><h3>Dwarves of the Five Nations</h3><p>Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes-and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.</p><p>When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?</p><h3>Dwarves and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Mark of Warding} </em>appears on dwarves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}, which had its origins as one of the clans of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}. @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Kundarak} dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.</p><p>In addition to providing all manner of security, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Dwarven Resilience]{Dwarven Resilience}:</span> Dwarves are hardy and resistant to toxins.

This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow-assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} and settled the island nation of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.</p><p>Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf, Drow]{drow}, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.</p><p>As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship wit.h the past: Do you value the traditions ofyour ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?</p><h3>Elves of the Five Nations</h3><p>Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there.</p><p>As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions ofyour ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.</p><p>Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?</p><h3>Elves and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadow}</em> first appeared among the elves of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan} line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.</p><p>Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadow} </em>appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Bladesan espionage agency in the service of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}'s Sibling Kings.</p><h3>Aereni and Tairnadal</h3><p>For thousands of years, the island nation of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.</p><p>Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars-against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Agile or Intelligence:</span> Tairnadal Elves tend to be graceful and agile, while Aereni elves tend to be highly intelligent.

Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living descendants about these shadows of the distant past.</p><p>When the elves fled to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}, the drow remained on @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} as subjects of the giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger on @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.</p><p>Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.</p><h3>A Drow Adventurer</h3><p>When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?</p><p>How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust. You might have overcome your initial prejudices by the time the campaign begins, or perhaps you're working to build trust with another elf member ofyour adventuring party.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Agile:</span> Drow are graceful and agile.

As refugees of the Sundering and subsequent expansion of Riedra, the eneko have now been forced into one of the last free corners of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}. Also known as \"mongrel ogres\", eneko are a true breeding race in their own right with a long and rich cultural heritage.</p><h3>Free People</h3><p>The home of the eneko, Syrkarn, is a sanctuary of freedom, diversity and humility built out of yuan-ti ruins by refugees fleeing the monolithic culture and military of Riedra. Eneko and humans equally make up the vast majority of the loose nation's inhabitants, and the philosophy of the eneko is difficult to separate from the region they call home. Eneko from Syrkarn value community, personal freedom, and honest labour above all.</p><p>Many eneko live in nomadic tribes, and those that make a home in Sykrarn's cities still must contend with the harsh storms of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona} and the dangerous ruins left by ancient civilizations. This trains into all eneko a profound respect for the land and its challenges, and hones their almost supernatural resilience to the elements. Eneko travelers are among the most difficult for Riedra's Thousand Eyes to track.</p><h3>Mixed Bloodlines</h3><p>Eneko originated from the pairings of the ogres of Borunan and the nomadic half-giants that wander the continent. According to half-giant legend, their people are the progeny of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}'s native humans and giant explorers from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}. Grandiose eneko may claim that the blood of the ancient human sorcerer kings and the mightiest titans of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} flows through their veins. While many Riedrans deride the eneko, labelling them \"mongrels\", eneko themselves view the diversity of their heritage as one of their greatest strengths.</p><h3>Dark Magic</h3><p>The arcane power displayed by their legendary forebearers leads many eneko to the study of magic. The cult of Karrak the Final Guardian, a deity sometimes called an aspect of the Keeper, is said to have its origins in the giants of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}.

Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.</p><h3>Gnomes of Zilargo</h3><p>To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some ofwhich persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals-of which there are many-often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.</p><p>Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.</p><p>When you're making a Zil gnome character, consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.</p><p>Additionally, consider your relationship to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}: why you have left, and what ties do you still have to it? Your scheme could provide a good reason for you to leave. Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories ofyour adventures back to the Korranberg Chronicle. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}. Ifyou are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent-gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.</p><p><strong>Zil Names. </strong>Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.</p><h3>Gnomes of the Five Nations</h3><p>As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.</p><p>As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.</p><h3>Gnomes and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{Mark of Scribing}</em> appears among the gnomes of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Amongst the most areas of Khorvaire goblins are at best second class citizens that are often nothing more than scavengers. Among the <em>dar</em> or goblinoid races, goblins are known as the <em>golin'dar</em>, the \"quick people\", known as crafters, skilled labor, and excellent scouts. Not knowing any better, when humans came to Khorvaire they named the goblinoid people after the most prolific breeders, goblins.</p><h3>City Goblins</h3><p>Goblins dwell in most o f the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} during the Last War.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Agile:</span> Goblins are naturally quick and agile.

New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term \"half-elf,\" instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning \"children of Khorvaire.\"</p><p>The elves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.</p><p>In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?</p><h3>Khorvar</h3><p>The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.</p><p>Many Khoravar espouse the idea of \"the bridge between,\" the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.</p><p>Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.</p><p>As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide inspiration for it.</p><h3>Half-evles and Dragonmarks</h3><p>Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{Mark of Detection} </em>is found in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} and the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{Mark of Storm} </em>in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}.

Half-giants, for the most part, retain human sensibilities. They are curious, interested in cooperation and communication, and have a general tendency toward kindness. (Half-Giants are from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona} and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}, talk to your DM if you want to play this race.)</p><p>Perhaps the most baffling of all the races on the continent, the nomadic half-giants of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona} are descendants of ancient giant explorers from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}. Some say the half-giants are degenerate offspring of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} titans, while others contend they have a mixed human ancestry.</p><p>What can be said is that the true-breeding half-giants are racially inclined toward psionic ability, and this racial trait binds them into tight-knit but individually isolated bands. Half-giants refer to their groups as families, rather than tribes or clans, although few members of a family are actually blood-related. In fact, many families adopt individuals of other races, particularly psionic ones such as elans, dromites, duergar, and maenads.</p><h3>Half-Giant Lands</h3><p>Half-giant families wander endlessly all over @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}, although they rarely stray into Riedran territory. There, they are often \"assimilated\"—a process beginning as slavery. What is remarkable is the degree to which they tend to coexist peaceably with denizens of all other regions. In Tashana, where families are known collectively as the Icebinders, half-giants have a long tradition of trade and cooperation with the shifter and human tribes. The Sandstrider families of Syrkarn keep more to themselves, with occasional but minimal conflict with the humans and eneko of the region. In @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Adar]{Adar}, a handful of half-giant families called the pathadrik wander among the settlements and monasteries.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Cumbersome]{Cumbersome}: </span>Half-giants aren't the most dextrous of creatures.

But in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p><p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p><ul><li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes.

The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use. </p><h3>Talenta Halflings</h3><p>The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.</p><p>As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.</p><p>Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halfiings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur—like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs ofyour home remains strong.</p><p>Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration. </p><h3>Halflings of the Five Nations</h3><p>Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.</p><p>Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sham, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Stormreach]{Stormreach}. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point ofcontact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron.</p><h3>Halflings and Dragonmarks</h3><p>Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Mark of Healing}</em> in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda's} <em> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Mark of Hospitality}</em>. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} received their first marks—centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}  joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.</p><p>With its powers related to food and shelter, the <em> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Mark of Hospitality}</em> was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the <em> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Mark of Healing}</em> has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Athletic: </span>Halflings are nimble beings.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Among the <em>dar</em> or goblin people, hobgoblins are known as <em>ghaal'dar</em> or \"mighty people\". Hobgoblins are the most organized and intelligent of the goblinoid species, often holding the positions of power and organization.</p><h3>The Ghaal'dar</h3><p>The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun. The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.</p><p>As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile?

Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.</p><h3>Bound to Spirits</h3><p>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature ofyour linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers.</p><h3>Hunted by Nightmares</h3><p>The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dominate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.</p><p>Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Dual Mind: </span>Because of the guidance from the quori spirit with which they are bonded, kalashtar begin play with a d6 @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Spirit} instead of a d4.

Such tieflings are touched by the fiendish forces bound beneath the Wastes, and the tribes consider them to be blessed. If you're playing such a tiefling, why have you left the Wastes? It could be that you were destined for some evil purpose-perhaps even serving as an avatar for an imprisoned Overlord-and you are fleeing that destiny.</p><p>Other tieflings are shaped not by fiendish powers, but by the influence of the fiend-tainted planes. Such tieflings might be born in manifest zones, where a plane exerts influence over a region. Planar tieflings are oddities, often seen as strange but not necessarily evil.</p><p>Finally, the Venomous Demesne—a city-state hidden on the far side of Droaam—is populated by tieflings. These tieflings descend from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}n mages who bargained with dark powers, with the Demesne's lords being powerful warlocks and wizards. The Venomous Demesne has had no significant contact with the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and few know it exists. Your character could be an envoy or exile from it, or simply an adventurer driven by a desire to see what lies beyond your homeland.</p><h3>Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h3><p>Tieflings rarely appear in the cities and towns of Khorvaire, with most dwelling at the fringes of civilization. Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.</p><p>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Darkvision]{Darkvision}:</span> Tieflings infernal heritage allows them to see into the darkness of Khyber.

While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.</p><h3>Living Steel and Stone</h3><p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.</p><p>Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids. </p><h3>Warforged Personality</h3><p>The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.</p><p>The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose—such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land—and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.</p><p>The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity.</p><p>The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Built for War:</span> Warforged were designed, built, and trained as tools of war.

They are reliable and predictable, and their powers are constructive. They create; they heal; they protect.</p><p>But there is another kind of dragonmark: marks that are unpredictable and dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Someone with such a mark can kill with a touch or control minds with a glance. Aberrant marks often apopear when people from different dragonmarked families produce a child, and for this reason such unions are absolutely forbidden by the Twelve. But aberrant dragonmarks can appear on members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two aberrant dragonmarks are exactly alike—even if they grant the same power, they may appear and manifest in different ways. If two aberrant marks might grant <a class=\"entity-link content-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers\" data-id=\"QBm57hlOSWLmnk0I\"><em>bolt</em></a>, one mark may be formed from scar tissue while another is traced on the skin in lines of cold fire.</p><p>While aberrant dragonmarks can be disturbing, on the surface an aberrant mark seems no more dangerous or threatening than the powers of a sorcerer. So, what makes them significant? First of all, aberrant marks always have flaws. These may not actively hurt a character, but they are always a burden in some way—a burden that could drive a weak-willed person to madness.</p><p>It takes time for a character to learn to control their mark, and in time people may be hurt. If an aberrant mark grants <a class=\"entity-link content-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers\" data-id=\"QBm57hlOSWLmnk0I\"><em>bolt</em></a>, the person who carries it might have severely burned or even killed a loved one. Imagine having the power to cast charm person but being unable to control it and having people you care about suddenly becoming slavishly devoted to you. All of these factors have led to the general superstition that people with aberrant dragonmarks are dangerous, that their marks drive them crazy or turn them into sociopaths. These are things that can happen; people have a right to be afraid. But it is possible for an aberrant to learn to control their mark and to endure the flaw.</p><h3>War of the Mark</h3><p>An aberrant dragonmark is a gift of mystical power, though it can be a painful and distressing curse to bear, and its powers might even be difficult or, in some cases, impossible to control. Even an ability that duplicates a spell as simple as fire bolt can be devastating to the individual, and a person who possesses such a mark could have killed friends or even destroyed city blocks in a fiery blaze before mastering this power. This has led the common people to fear those who carry aberrant marks, paranoid that all of them could be murderers, mad, or both. The progenitor dragon Khyber is said to be the source of all things monstrous and evil, and those who carry aberrant dragonmarks in adolescence are called Children of Khyber.</p><p>Aberrant marks are feared for another reason, too. Long ago, aberrant marks were more common and some held great powers. Aberrant leader Halas Tarkanan could devastate cities with powerful earthquakes. The Lady of the Plague wielded disease and commanded hordes of vermin. The dragonmarked houses united in an inquisition called the War of the Mark. Some say this was a persecution of innocents, but most feared the aberrants and stood by as the houses hunted them down. Following the War of the Mark, aberrant dragonmarks were few in number and relatively weak. But since the Mourning, aberrant marks have been appearing in greater numbers.</p><h3>Trappings</h3><p>All trappings of the powers from aberrant dragonmarks should reflect the general destructive and often painful qualities of the dragonmark.</p><h2>Arcane Background (Alchemist)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Artificer)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Bard)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Cleric)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Druid)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Elementalist)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Illusionist)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Infernalist)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Magewright)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Necromancer)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Psion)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Shaman)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Summoner)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Witch/Warlock)</h2><h2>Arcane Background (Wizard)</h2></div></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":50000,"name":"Character Creation Summary","type":"text","_id":"9vucjAS2aThErtQh","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\"><h1 class=\"wide\">Character Creation Summary</h1><h3>Concept</h3><ul class=\"bullet\"><li>Start with a general idea of what you want to play.

This might mean defeating powerful enemies, saving a true love, or overcoming some great mystery or problem.</p><p>The victory should be an achievement over and above the usual. A vampire hunter in <cite>Rippers</cite> shouldn’t get Conviction every time he kills a vampire, for example, but he might when he wipes out an entire coven or slays a powerful master vamp­ire. A super hero might gain Conviction when she saves her true love from a death trap or the clutches of a powerful villain. She wouldn’t earn it just because her boyfriend is in a dangerous encounter.</p><p><strong>Tragedy:</strong> Some of the most interesting heroes of fiction, film, and legend spend as much time battling their personal demons as they do fighting their foes. Eventually these same issues give them strength as they work through their grief or overcome obstacles to rise once more against the challenges they face.</p><p>When a character experiences a significant personal loss or destructive event, and the DM feels it’s appropriate, he gains Conviction. The death of a loved one or close friend (including a party member he was close to), losing an important job, giving in to harmful character flaws and vices, being removed from a case or quest, or getting framed for a crime are all classic examples of heroic tragedy.</p><p>These might happen in the course of the game, but players should also proactively suggest their own ideas to the Dungeon Master. Consider your hero’s backstory and occasionally look for ways to do what your favorite authors do to their characters—torture them! Think about what’s important to them and threaten it or take it away. Most of the time this should be done as a quick narrative tale or a scene with a little interaction and roleplaying so as not to distract from the main campaign or the other players’ time, but occasionally it might inspire a side-trek or adventure to regain—or avenge!—whatever was lost.</p><p>Note that earning Conviction for harmful behavior is motivation for players in a game to occasionally spotlight their character’s dark side. It is not an endorsement or rationalization of poor conduct in the real world.</p><h2 class=\"example\">Example: Red's Rage</h2><p>Emily is Red, a fighter in a fantasy campaign. She has “anger management issues” but didn’t take the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.Mean]{Mean} Hindrance because she’s had her problem under control for a year or so. But it’s a fun part of her backstory and Emily loves roleplaying constantly managing her character’s temper.</p><p>Unfortunately, Red and her constant ally Gabe failed in their last adventure.

However, there is a price to pay for villainy.</p><p>Heroes who perform heroic deeds earn bonuses through their elevated Glory—villains get very little reward for being evil.

A king may be well known across the lands, but that does not make him a hero, nor does it entitle him to become the focus of ballads or epic poems. Only through heroic deeds can a character aspire to enter the history books and oral myths of Eberron.</p><p>Your hero's Glory starts at zero, but can be affected by his or her actions during the course of the game. The higher your hero's Glory, the more renowned he is across Eberron and the more benefits he gains.</p><p>Just as Glory define the acts of a hero, so does Infamy define the acts of a villian. Infamy is Glory that has gone into the \"negative\".</p><h3>Glory vs. Rank</h3><p>A hero's Rank is a measure of his experience, although it does incorporate a degree of glory. Rank is a by-product of earning experience in adventures and quests, which aren't always linked to heroic deeds. Sure, the hero may rescue a princess, but the rescue might be fairly mundane and quickly forgotten. Only deeds which attract attention count toward Glory.</p><h2>Gaining Glory</h2><p>Glory is measured in Glory Points. Characters can rise to become famous heroes or slip into mediocrity or do deeds so heinous that they are remembered in Infamy.</p><p>Glory should not be dolled out like candy. It should be earned through heroic endeavors, good roleplaying, and investing heavily in character, not expected just because the hero is a player character.</p><h2>Variable Glorious Deeds</h2><p>After each adventure, and only when the heroes return to civilization, one of the party may begin telling the tale of their epic battles and heroic deeds. The character makes a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll, modified as below.</p><p>The DM is always free to add positive modifiers for truly heroic actions or based on the character's weaknesses and how he overcame them. Always try to think of how the heroes' true exploits (as opposed to any extra bits they invent) sound as a tale told by skalds. This is important, as it is the listeners on Khorvaire who are effectively granting them Glory.</p><p>Ideally, an extra +1 or +2 should be the maximum. For instance, slaying a dread liche is certainly worthy of praise, but that is already covered in the table. However, lopping off his head with a Called Shot as the killing blow is worth a small modifier, as it's the sort of detail found in epic poems.</p><p>Likewise, a Novice party with a d6 as their highest combat skill (including @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skills}) who slay a bunch of orc warriors in melee without any assistance should be rewarded with a greater chance of fame.</p><p>The DM may also opt to add penalties to reflect weaker opponents (such as unarmed or unarmored orcs) or favorable character circumstances (every hero had a dozen alchemical <em>blast</em> devices on hand).</p><table><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Glorious Deeds</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Reason</th><th class=\"sub-heading centered\" style=\"width:20%\">Modifer</th></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Stroryteller</span></th></tr><tr><td>Is a bard/skald/storyteller</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td>Has negative Glory</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–2</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Highest Character Rank</span></th></tr><tr><td>Seasoned</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–1</td></tr><tr><td>Veteran</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–2</td></tr><tr><td>Heroic</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–4</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–6</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">highest Number of Foes</span></th></tr><tr><td>You outnumbered them</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–1</td></tr><tr><td>They outnumbered you more than 2 to 1</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td>They outnumbered you more than 4 to 1</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td></tr><tr><td>They outnumbered you more than 10 to 1</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+4</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Highest Foe's Toughness</span></th></tr><tr><td>4 or less</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–1</td></tr><tr><td>5 to 6</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+0</td></tr><tr><td>7 to 10</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td>11 to 15</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td></tr><tr><td>16 to 20</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+4</td></tr><tr><td>21 or more</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+6</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Wild Cards</span></th></tr><tr><td>Per Wild Card</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td>Per named Wild Card</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td></tr><tr><td>Per Wild Card killed in a single blow</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+4</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">magic</span></th></tr><tr><td>A foe had an AB with 5 or less powers</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td>A foe had an AB with 6 to 10 powers</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td></tr><tr><td>A foe had an AB with 11+ powers</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+4</td></tr><tr><td>The had power magical items</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td>The foe had a relic</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Arcane Background:</strong> Where multiple foes with an @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Arcane Backgrounds]{Arcane Backgrounds} were defeated, only the highest bonus applies.</p><p><strong>Character Rank: </strong>The higher the heroes' @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.saneNpHYSTivNRYE]{Rank}, the more dangerous foes they must overcome before anyone is interested in their tales.

As such, only record the greatest number of foes slain in a single encounter. Defeating three orcs in one room and eight in another equates to only eight orcs.</p><p>The party size includes any allies on the heroes' side—a party with 20 members must defeat a lot of foes at once to get noticed. Even if the heroes forget to mention their helpers, any survivors will be telling their own stories across Rassilon.</p><p><strong>Single Blow:</strong> A @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} killed in a single blow must have been unwounded when the killing blow was delivered. Chopping the head off a dread liche with 3 wounds is not exactly heroic.</p><p>Likewise, the foe must have been aware of the party and capable of retaliation—slaughtering sleeping dragons or <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Entangle]{entangled}</em> giants doesn't make a good story, though the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Entangle]{entangle}</em> spell might be worth a small bonus.</p><p><strong>Storyteller:</strong> Although anyone can tell a story, skalds are trained in using the right words and adjusting the rhythm to keep an audience enthralled. They can turn even a mundane adventure into an epic struggle.</p><h3>Glory Awards</h3><p>With a success, every hero involved in the action gains 1d6 Glory. A raise increases this to 2d6. Failure earns no bonus or penalty. A critical failure, however, causes the loss of 1d6 Glory, perhaps because the listeners disbelieved the storyteller or doubt the prowess of the party to achieve what they claim. Roll the dice for each individual member of the party earning or losing Glory.</p><p>Glory awards can be altered by the GM, but this should be done only for truly notable actions. Modifiers normally apply solely to individual members of the party, not every member.</p><p>For instance, the hero who delivered the Called Shot to the head, killing the dread liche, should earn a +1 or +2 bonus for his notable deed. This actively encourages use of special maneuvers and imaginative combat, as opposed to the standard \"attack–damage\" routine.</p><p>Of course, if one hero played little part in the action, perhaps because he was Incapacitated early on or spent the whole time cowering in fear, he should receive less Glory than those who were in the thick of the action. Just because he's a player character and was present does not entitle him to the same reward as those who risked their lives and took part in the bulk of the action.</p><p>Such a hero may roll his dice with a –3 penalty, for example, possibly earning a small penalty overall with an unlucky roll because of his inaction.</p><h2>Fixed Glory Awards</h2><p>Fixed Glory awards cover lesser deeds not played out (such as events during long periods of downtime), killing smaller number of foes during an adventure (they do slowly add up over time), or rewards for which there are many witnesses (battles or rescues). These are in addition to any Glory gained above.</p><p>DM's are encouraged to devise their own modifiers for things like concluding peace treaties or founding new mercantile routes that benefit a large population. Although notable deeds, the rewards for these types of endeavor should not be overly high—few people will remember who signed a peace treaty, but you can bet they'll recall a hero who risked his life to venture into the heavily guarded camp of the enemy commander and kill him in an epic duel.</p><h2>Achieve Rank</h2><p>Even without performing major heroic deeds, a hero can become famous through his collective lesser deeds. Such rewards are typical of the examples above, especially the slaying of lesser foes.</p><p>These are wrapped into a single +5 Glory bonus gained when a hero achieves a new Rank. It is possible, though rare, for a hero to reach Legendary status with no additional Glory—he has performed many deeds, but none stand out as truly heroic.</p><h2>Mass Battles</h2><p>War is a terrible thing and something sane men avoid, but it can also grow and break reputations.</p><p>Use the table below whenever the characters are involved in a fight using the Mass Battle rules. Whereas skirmishes are commonplace, true mass battles remain rare events. Hence, all Glory modifiers are fixed.</p><table class=\"centered\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\"><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Glory for Mass Battles</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Reason</th><th class=\"sub-heading centered\" style=\"width:20%\">Modifier</th></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Size</span></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Smallest army had hundreds of troops</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Smallest army had thousands of troops</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+3</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Smallest army had more than 10,000 troops</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+5</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Enemy</span></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Hated rival of your nation</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+/–1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Undead Army</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+/–2</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Victory</span></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Enemy had less tokens or was equal</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">For each token the enemy had above yours</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Defeat</span></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Enemy had more tokens or was equal</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">For each token less your enemy had</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–3</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Personal heroics</span></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Two raises on Heroes in Mass Battles rolls</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Commander</span></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">You commanded the army</td><td style=\"width:20%\">x2</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Character Roll:</strong> Scoring a double raise is more than just a die result. It represents a major event within a battle, such as slaying an enemy commander or slaughtering so many foes a battalion breaks.</p><p>However, the modifier only applies if the number of enemy tokens was less than or equal to your army's tokens at the time (slaying an enemy commander when you have a +3 bonus is nowhere near as heroic as when you have a –3 penalty.</p><p><strong>Commander: </strong>A hero who commands an army gains greater Glory than his troops for victory, but also suffers more ignominy if he loses the field. Take the final Glory modifier and double it to see what the hero earned.</p><p><strong>Defeat:</strong> Defeat is never easy to live with, but the ignominy is far worse if you outnumbered your foe. For each token you outnumbered your enemy at the start of a battle you suffer a –3 penalty.</p><p><strong>Enemy Forces: </strong>Certain races are more despised than others. To qualify for the bonus, the specific enemy must account for more than 75% of the enemy army's troop strength.</p><p>Add the modifier if the heroes won, and subtract it if they lost (a defeat by a hated foe usually means the enemy will grow more confident and thus pose a greater danger in the future).</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>Huge armies are rare in Khorvaire now the Last War is over, and thus while any battle earns Glory, the more participants there are the greater the tale told.</p><p><strong>Victory: </strong>Everybody loves a winner. The greater the size of the enemy army, the more reward is earned. For each token your enemy's army was larger than yours when battle commenced, the hero earns a +2 Glory bonus.</p><h2>Rescue</h2><p>Even if the heroes' tale of how they killed a hundred orcs doesn't earn them any immediate Glory, having prisoners recount the tale of their rescue quickly causes word to spread.</p><p>Important NPCs must be famous, powerful, and named. A merchant, wizard, priest, minor noble, or similar is worth +1 Glory. Saving a count or a skilled spellcaster is worth +3. Rescuing a prince, king, or truly powerful spellcaster gains the hero +5 Glory.</p><p>For groups of lesser NPCs, rescuing ten or so is worth +1 Glory, a few tens +2, and a hundred or more +3. Saving a lone villager from an orc tribe is brave, but not enough to be retold by skalds.</p><p>Rescue doesn't have to mean entering a prison and breaking captives out. Liberating a village beset by frostreavers, for instance, counts as a rescue. If the rescue involves a Mass Battle rather than tabletop action, the party is deserving of the Mass Battle rewards as well.</p><h2>Glory Benefits</h2><p>Being a hero has its perks. When a hero reaches a multiple of 20 Glory he must immediately pick one benefit from the list below, meeting any requirements. Some heroes may opt to acquire Followers or become leaders of men and build a personal army. Others might use their fame to gain valuable connections or become better combatants, while others may prefer to rely on their reputation to ensure a friendly welcome in civilized lands.</p><p>Unless otherwise stated, benefits can be taken multiple times—the number in parentheses after the name indicates the maximum number of times the benefit may be taken. Fill in the appropriate section of the character sheet.</p><p>Should Glory drop below a multiple of 20, any benefits above the character's current Glory level are temporarily lost (unless otherwise stated) until Glory is regained. Dropping below 20 and then rising above it again does not grant the opportunity to take a new benefit—it simply allows the “lost” one to be used again.</p><table class=\"centered\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\"><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"3\">Glory Edges</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Edge</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Requirements</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Summary</th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Combat Prowess]{Combat Prowess}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">20+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Gain a Combat Edge.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Connection]{Connection}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">40+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Hero gains friend(s) among an organzition aligned with him.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Favored]{Favored}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">60+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Hero gains an extra @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Benny}.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Followers (Glory)]{Followers}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">40+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Hero gains @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Followers]{Followers}, as per the Edge.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Heroic Aura]{Heroic Aura}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">40+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">The Hero's @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Making Characters]{Toughness} increases by 1.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Heroic Status]{Heroic Status}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">20+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 bonus to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Reaction Table]{Reaction Table} results, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Intimidation]{Intimidation}, and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Networking]{Networking}.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Immortalized in Song]{Immortalized in Song}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Heroic Status taken 4 times</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Number of Followers the Hero has doubles.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Leader of Men]{Leader of Men}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">40+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Hero can take a Leadership Edge.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Sidekick]{Sidekick}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">80+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Leader gains the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Sidekick]{Sidekick} Edge.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class=\"example\">Example: Barak the Fair</h2><p><em>Dave's character, Barak the Fair, has the Heroic Status benefit, which he took he reached 20 Glory.

At –40, this changes to the Major version.</p><p>Generally, the Minor Hindrance extends to a single realm, usually the one where the Glory penalty was incurred. The Major version, on the other hand, covers pretty much all the civilized, settled domains of Khorvaire. A hero who gains enough Glory to rise above the rating at which he gained this Hindrance, doesn't lose the Hindrance. He may have performed some heroic deeds, but he is still a wanted man.</p><h3>Enemy</h3><p>At –10 Glory, the hero acquires the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Enemy]{Enemy} (Minor) Hindrance.

This typically ranges from −4 for particularly slow or sluggish vehicles to +4 for those that can turn on a dime.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Top Speed:</span> Top Speed is expressed in miles per hour (MPH) for easy comparison to the real world. To convert miles per hour to Pace, multiply MPH by 1.5.</li><li><p><span class=\"list-heading\">Toughness:</span> The vehicle’s base durability, including Armor in parentheses. Use these as guides when creating your own.<br />Vehicles can normally take three Wounds before they’re <strong>Wrecked</strong> (see below), but Large Vehicles can take one additional Wound, Huge vehicles two, and Gargantuan three.</p></li><li><p><span class=\"list-heading\">Crew:</span> The first score is the number of crew required to operate the ship’s sails, rigging, and so on. Having less than this number subtracts 2 from the crew’s Boating rolls, and having less than half the required number subtracts 4. Sailors must have a minimum Boating skill of d6 to count as crew. <br />The required crew does not count gunners. Each gun fired or reloaded in a round requires two gunners. Note that most vessels can get by with manning only half the guns at any one time (since they’re firing only on one side). </p></li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Passengers:</span> The number after the plus is the number of passengers the vessel can easily accommodate, including places to eat, sleep, and linger. Up to twice this number can travel for short distances (about a day or less).</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Cost:</span> The typical price of the vehicle in Eberron. This will vary widely depending on the type of vehicle, the environment, its condition, and other market factors.</li><li><p><span class=\"list-heading\">Cargo Space:</span> This is the number of cargo spaces the ship has. Cargoes are bought by “spaces” rather than having to keep track of every individual bunch of bananas or carton of grapes. <br />The exact dimensions of cargo spaces are deliberately vague to keep bookkeeping to a minimum. If it becomes important to know, each cargo space is roughly six feet square. <br />A cargo space may be converted to hold two guns instead (one on either side of the vessel).</p></li></ul><h2>Vehicle Notes</h2><p><strong>Heavy Armor:</strong> Only weapons marked as Heavy Weapons can hurt this vehicle, regard­less of the damage roll. This keeps a lucky bow shot from destroying a longship, for example. Vehicles with Heavy Armor halve damage they take from colliding with other obstacles (including vehicles) that don’t have Heavy Armor. This is not to be confused with the heavy category of personal armor.</p><p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Vehicles with weapons note their location for narrative play or when using miniatures on the tabletop. Here are the most common:</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Fixed:</span> The vehicle’s weapon fires only in the listed direction (typically front or rear in a 45° arc).</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Swivel Mount:</span> The weapon is mounted on a post or platform that can turn and fire in a 180° arc in the listed direction.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Turret:</span> The weapon is in a turret and can freely fire in a 360° arc.</li></ul><div><img src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/general/jewelry.webp\" /></div><aside class=\"sidebar\"><h1>Vehicle damage</h1><p>A vehicle can take three Wounds before it’s wrecked.

Unless an attacker states otherwise, hits are always directed at the victim’s torso.</p><p>Worn armor doesn't stack with other worn armor, but does stack with natural armor (such as scaly skin) at its full value.</p><h2>Armor Piercing (AP)</h2><p>The weapon or projectile ignores this many points of Armor value. A weapon with an AP value of 4, for instance, ignores 4 points of Armor. Excess AP is lost.</p><h2>Brace</h2><p>The weapon counts as having +1 Reach when determining who has the greater Reach when set against a charge (see Mounted Combat).</p><h2>Damage</h2><p>Damage is listed in terms of dice. Projectile weapons have fixed damage (such as 2d6). Melee weapons have damage based on the wielder’s Strength die plus another die, as listed under individual weapon entries. A dagger, for instance, inflicts Str+d4 damage.</p><h2>Heavy weapon (HW)</h2><p>The weapon can affect vehicles or other devices with <strong>Heavy Armor</strong> (see @UUID[Compendium.swpf-core-rules.swpf-rules.swpfcore02gear00.JournalEntryPage.02vehicles000000]{Vehicles}). This is not to be confused with categories of personal armor— such as heavy armor or shields.</p><h2>Minimum Strength</h2><p>Certain items have a “Minimum Strength” required to use without penalty. Note that some items list a d4 since it is possible to have a Strength lower than d4.</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Armor/Shields/Worn Gear:</span> Each die type differ­ence between the character’s Strength and the item’s Minimum Strength inflicts a −1 penalty to Pace (minimum of 1), Agility, and Agility-related skill rolls. This is cumulative for those weak but determined adventurers who wear or use multiple items too heavy for their build.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Melee/Thrown Weapons:</span> A thrown or melee weapon’s damage die is limited by the user’s Strength die. If a scrawny kid (Strength d4) picks up a long sword (Str+d8), he rolls d4+d4 damage instead of d4+d8. Also, if the user’s Strength is less than its Minimum Strength, he doesn’t benefit from any of the weapon’s positive abilities such as Reach or Parry bonuses. He still retains any penalties, however.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Weapons:</span> The user suffers a −1 attack penalty for each die step difference between his Strength and the weapon’s minimum.</li></ul><h2>Parry</h2><p>The weapon adds the bonus to the character’s Parry score. If a character wields a weapon in each hand, penalties to Parry stack but bonuses do not (unless she has the Ambidextrous Edge). This also applies to carrying two shields at once (use the best Parry bonus).</p><h2>Range</h2><p>This lists the weapon’s Short, Medium, and Long Range. Extreme Range is up to 4×its Long Range. See <strong>@UUID[Compendium.swpf-core-rules.swpf-rules.swpfcore03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03combat00000000]{Ranged Attacks}</strong> for @Compendium[swpf-core-rules.swpf-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} or @Compendium[swpf-core-rules.swpf-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} (throwing) modifiers and more details.</p><p>Ranges are listed in inches so you can use a ruler to move, shoot, and fight on the tabletop with miniatures. If you’re not using miniatures, each inch equals two yards (6 feet).</p><p>Weapon ranges are “effective” ranges for the table-top.</p><h2>Reach</h2><p>Weapons with “Reach” allow their user to make Fighting attacks at the listed range. A Reach of 1, for example, allows a character to strike a target 1″ (2 yards) distant. Weapons without a Reach value can only strike targets at arm’s length (adjacent).</p><p>Reach can be very important when fighting from horseback and <em>against</em> mounted foes (see @UUID[Compendium.swpf-core-rules.swpf-rules.swpfcore03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03combat00000000]{Mounted Combat}).</p><h2>Reload</h2><p>A character can ready and fire a bow every action— see @UUID[Compendium.swpf-core-rules.swpf-rules.swpfcore02gear00.JournalEntryPage.02gear0000000000]{Reloading}. Heavy crossbows and black powder muskets are slower to reload. The number after the Reload keyword is how many actions of reloading it takes before a weapon can be fired again.</p><h2>Two Hands</h2><p>A two-handed weapon can be used with one hand at a −4 penalty. The hero counts full Strength for damage but loses all other advantages such as Reach or Parry bonuses.</p><p>Two-handed weapons are normally required to make use of the Sweep Edge.</p><h2>Weapon Size</h2><p>Weapons wielded by some creatures may be larger or smaller than those listed here A Giant's battleaxe, for example, is larger than a human's, while a kobold's longsword is smaller. The GM can increase or decrease the Minimum Strength and weight as logically needed, but other statistics (Range, damage, etc.) remain as listed.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Armor","type":"text","_id":"lqXUYuw4NjqgE9Wp","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\"><h1 class=\"wide\">Armor</h1><table><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"5\">Armor</th></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><p>Armor is written in parentheses next to a character’s Toughness, like this: 11 (2).

A magewright beautician can perform a range of minor transformations—for a price.</p><p>Minor cosmetic transmutation is quite common; most professional beauticians can change your hair or eye color. Unnatural effects are rarer, seen mainly in Aundair and Zilargo; metallic hair colors are a recent fad in Fairhaven, and in the days before Galifar, the nobles of Thaliost would adopt elf features. The effects of cosmetic transmutation typically last a week, but if you’re dealing with a magewright of sufficient skill, you can extend the effect to one month. In some cities, you might even find an expert who can make the change permanent.

They serve as troops under your hero’s command in war, loyal retainers serving strongholds, or fellow fighters in glorious rebellions against oppression.</p><p><strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Use these rules to help keep track of the party’s followers and give them a little extra personality to play off of as well.</p><p><strong>The Basics:</strong> Players create, control, and track their own followers and nonplayer character allies.</p><h2>Using Allies</h2><p>Keeping up with allies in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is simple. Just download the Ally Sheet from our website and fill in the blanks.</p><p>Allied @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Extras} are divided up among all the players to control. This is a very important part of <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> because our adventures often feature allied bands of skilled hirelings, fellow grunts, or loyal retainers, and the game is designed to handle them quickly and easily. It’s also designed for the players to control them — not the Dungeon Master.</p><p>It doesn’t matter whether the <em>characters</em> control the allies, only that the <em>players</em> do. This keeps everyone involved in the action even if his hero is out of the fight, and makes running large combats much easier and more fun for everyone. Of course the DM can always take charge of Extras when the need arises, but with good roleplayers this is rarely necessary.</p><h3>Allied Personalities</h3><p>You can add a little flavor to your allies by rolling on the <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-tables.Allied Personalities]{Allied Personalities}</strong> table. Jot down the keyword on the Ally Sheet so you and your Dungeon Master have a little insight into each particular ally’s character.</p><p>Consider these general impressions with no particular game effect.

Here’s an easy and dramatic way to handle this problem.</p><p>The ammo level of each group of allied @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Extras} starts at Very High, High (the usual level), Low, or Out, as determined by the GM.</p><p>After each fight, the ammo automatically drops a level. This makes for dramatic situations and realistic logistical problems while eliminating the bookkeeping.</p><p>The DM can always decide otherwise, of course. Perhaps the troops are told to fight with hand weapons instead of their bows and crossbows, or they don’t get to fire off more than a couple of shots before the fight is over.</p><div><img src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/general/p144_figure_collage.webp\" /></div><h2>Typical Allies</h2><p>Here are a few typical archetypes you might use for your <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> game.

Here are some guidelines.</p><p>Assume each player will average one success per turn. Use that as a guideline if you want the task to be \"fair,\" and set the number of rounds from three to five as appropriate. A party of five given three rounds to save a galleon in a storm, for example, needs to accumulate 15 Task Tokens in three rounds. Increase or decrease the number of tokens to make it more or less challenging.</p><p>If the number of tokens achieved is a measure of success rather than a straight win/fail condition, such as rescuing victims from a fire or hauling up bags of gold from a collapsing mineshaft, simply set the possible number of tokens that may be gathered in the time allowed. Each token gathered represents a person saved, a bag recovered, etc. It’s up to you whether it’s possible to save them all (using the guide above) or not.</p><p>Let the party choose how many will attempt the task, especially if there’s something else going on at the same time. Deciding how many heroes will break into the jail to rescue a friend while the others fight off the corrupt city guard allows <em>them</em> to choose their tactics.</p><h2>Performing the Task</h2><p>Characters are dealt @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#action-cards-(initiative)]{Action Cards} as usual during a Dramatic Task. Those attempting the task make relevant skill checks and get a Task Token for each success and raise. Failure means no progress and a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} reduces progress by one (if any has been made).</p><p>The skills that can be used to accumulate tokens depends on the situation. They might be defined, such as @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} to disable a trap, or they might be open — a heroic paladin might use @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} to carry people from a burning building while a mage uses <em>telekinesis</em> (@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Spellcasting]{Spellcasting}) to do the same.</p><h3>Multiple Skills</h3><p>The DM can break tasks down into steps if she likes, each of which might require different skills. If disabling a difficult trap in the dark, for example, the heroes might first have to get two tokens to get the feel for their surroundings using @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, then three more tokens using Thievery to cut all three trip wires in the correct order.</p><p>Requiring multiple skills throughout the task makes it more difficult since raises from one type of skill check don’t carry over to the other. In the trap example above, for example, the first step requires two Notice successes. Additional successes <em>don’t</em> carry over to the Thievery rolls needed afterward.</p><h3>Complications</h3><p>If a character’s Action Card is a Club, something has gone wrong. Attempts to resolve the task (or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support} it!) are made at an additional −2.</p><p>Worse, if a roll is failed during a Complication, the Dramatic Task fails — the trap springs, the lock jams, a victim cannot be saved, and so on. The character may choose <em>not</em> to attempt a roll on a turn he has a Complication — it just costs him precious time.</p><p><strong>Support:</strong> Characters assisting (via Support)also suffer the Complication penalty, and an additional −2 if <em>their</em> Action Card is a Club! @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} on their part just subtracts from the lead’s roll as usual, however, it doesn’t cause the entire task to fail.</p><h3>Death Traps</h3><p>Think carefully before designing Dramatic Tasks that might wipe out the entire party if failed. The threat of catastrophe should be very real but you don’t want a couple of bad die rolls to end the entire game.</p><p>Instead of total disaster, maybe the party has a moment to dive clear before the trap triggers. They don’t perish, but later awake in the care of a local healer or are captured and find themselves about to experience a new type of adventure.</p><h2 class=\"example\">Example: Dragon fire!</h2><p>An evil red dragon roams the countryside, burning farms and villages throughout the land. @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Seelah]{Seelah} the paladin and @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Harsk]{Harsk} the ranger watch in horror as the dragon breathes fire down on their favorite tavern. The pair rush to aid the choking and gasping patrons attempting to flee the burning building.</p><p>The Dungeon Master decides rescuing the survivors is a three-round, Multi-Person Dramatic Task. There are 10 patrons. Each success saves one of them from the inferno.</p><p>On the first round, Seelah and Harsk roll @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} to run into the tavern and drag someone out. Both get a raise, so that's four citizens saved!</p><p>The next round, Harsk gets a Complication. The DM decides he becomes trapped in one of the back rooms and must make a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} roll at −2. If he fails, it takes him too long to escape and he won't be able to save any more patrons. Harsk draws his brother's trusty @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Axe, Battle]{battleaxe} and hacks his way free. He decides to go with it and narrates using his Fighting to hack open a hole in the wall for the survivors. He's successful, and Seelah gets a raise this turn with @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} — yelling at the locals to help throw water on the fire. That's seven total patrons saved.</p><p>On the third round, Seelah gets a Complication and fails — she's choking on smoke and can't help.

In all cases, a being can’t be forced to resist the same type of poison more than once per round.</p><p><em>Contact poisons</em> must touch bare skin. They can also be applied to a weapon and remain effective for four hours.</p><p><em>Inhaled poisons</em> are released by breaking their container. They form a Medium Blast Template cloud and affect everyone within.</p><p><em>Ingested poisons</em> must be consumed. The target may make a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} roll to detect the poison’s smell or taste before consuming.</p><p><em>Injury poisons</em> must be applied to a piercing or cutting weapon, and are delivered when an attack isn’t Soaked and results in Shaken.</p><h3>Purchasing Poisons</h3><p>Whether poisons can be bought openly or not depends on the setting. In most fantasy worlds, mild poisons or those used to take care of vermin or other common nuisances are readily available. Those typically used for more sinister purposes must be obtained via the black market or from those who set themselves off from the rest of society.</p><h3>Crafting Poisons</h3><p>Characters can make their own poisons for half the cost listed below. Doing so uses the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Healing]{Healing}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Science]{Science}, or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Survival]{Survival} skill and d6 hours of preparation per batch.

An antidote only works against the specific type of poison for which it is created, and gives the user a Vigor roll minus half the strength of the poison to recover completely from its effects (including removing Hindrances for Lotus Dust).</p><p>As long as a chracter has a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Healer's Kit]{Healer's Kit} they may make a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Healing]{Healing} roll minus the strength of the poison (if any modifier is listed) to stop its effects.

These tell you everything you need to know about its concealment, complexity, type, and lethality. Very occasionally you'll need to draw a third card, but the rules below tell you when to do this.</p><p>The DM should add suitable flavor to these draws based on the trap type. For instance, a \"blade trap\" could be a scything blade slicing from the wall at knee height or a spear which thrusts out from a concealed hole. A Spade result on the trap might indicate multiple blades, hence the high Fighting die and increased damage. A portcullis of the Club suit might be heavily corroded or made of wood, whereas a Spade indicates extremely tough and well-made bars.</p><h3>First Card</h3><p>The first card determines how difficult the trap is to detect and disarm. This is shown on the <strong>Trap Difficulty Table</strong> below as modifiers to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery] rolls.</p><p>Note that <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Glyph]{glyph}</em> traps cannot be disarmed by mundane means (and so ignore the suit), but they can be <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Dispel]{dispelled} </em>and negated. Use the suit entry of the second card on the Trap Type table below to determine the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} die for this purpose.</p><p><strong>Detecting: </strong>Detecting a trap requires a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} roll. Unless a character has @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Danger Sense], searching for traps requires an action. A @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#movement]{running} hero rolls at –2. A single roll is made in a round, regardless of how far the hero moves. With success, he detects the first trap adjacent to him. A @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} locates a second trap within line of sight, if such exists. The hero may halt his movement if he spots a trap (advisable if it's right in front of him).</p><p><strong>Disarming: </strong>Disarming a detected trap requires a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery] roll and takes a complete round (no other actions possible, including movement). On a critical failure, the trap activates and automatically affects the unfortunate hero.</p><table><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"4\">Trap Difficulty</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Value</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Detect</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Suit</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Disarm</th></tr><tr><td>Joker</td><td>+2</td><td>Joker</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>2–4</td><td>+1</td><td>Club</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>5–10</td><td>0</td><td>Diamond</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Jack–Queen</td><td>–1</td><td>Heart</td><td>–1</td></tr><tr><td>King–Ace</td><td>–2</td><td>Spade</td><td>–2</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Second Card</h3><p>The second card determines the exact type of trap encountered.

Traps with a Wild Die apply it to rolls to all Trait rolls, when applicable.</p><p><strong>Area: </strong>Traps usually affect a 1\" square on the battle grid. Ranged attacks use the standard range brackets for the type of missile launched. Whatever projectile is launched, range is calculated as normal. The distance listed for pits is their depth. <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Glyph]{Glyph} </em>traps affect an area or operate at range as per the spell description and the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} die.</p><p><strong>Duration: </strong>Traps are generally one-shot devices. Once activated, they must be reset in order to work again. Portcullises remain in place until lifted up.</p><p><strong>Initiative:</strong> Most traps activate with little warning to the unfortunate victim. Outside of combat use the rules for @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Surprise]. In combat, traps being on Hold and roll to interrupt. Traps have @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Agility} d10 for this purpose.

Arcane = @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill}. Used when a spell activates, requires an attribute die value for any reason, and to resist dispel attempts.

The trap is fairly complex, but not very well disguised. Unfortunately, Aelric isn't looking out for traps and walks straight onto it. The DM decides it is a pressure plate mechanism.</p><p>As this occurs outside of combat, Aelric rolls his Notice to avoid Surprise. He adds +1 from the first card's value, and scores 8. The DM tells Aelric he hears an audible click as his foot hits the floor and deals him an action card. Aelric declares he wants to move clear of the square he is on.

They build coalitions, train armies, discover powerful artifacts, and finally stand against the enemy in desperate and glorious battle.</p><p>The rules presented here allow the Dungeon Master to handle a small warband holding a fort against an undead horde, a siege against a walled city, or even full divisions of troops fighting across a massive battlefield. The process is abstract, but it provides a narrative base for heroes to plan, get involved, and take part in the carnage!</p><p><strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Use the Mass Battle rules when you need to resolve a large conflict that can go either way, and also allow the player characters to have a role in its outcome. The culmination of these tales is not always a foregone conclusion, and failure can be just as interesting as victory!</p><p><strong>The Basics:</strong> Each side has a number of “Force Tokens” equal to its relative strength and size. Commanders roll their @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Battle]{Battle} skill each turn. The winner reduces his rival’s force until one side or the other breaks.</p><h2>Setup</h2><p>To start, give the larger or more powerful army 10 Force Tokens. Give the opposing army a proportional number of tokens. If one army has 10,000 warriors, for example, and the other has 7,000, give the smaller army seven tokens. These represent the troops, ships, and other assets in each side’s army.</p><p>Adjust the ratio as makes sense to account for special or elite troops, better equipment, and so on. If one army is half as powerful as another, for example, give one side 10 Force Tokens and the other five. Get close enough to give a reasonable approximation of relative strength. The dice and the players’ actions will handle the rest.</p><h2>Battle</h2><p>At the start of each round, the player characters discuss and decide on their plan. Then the attackers make an opposed @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Battle]{Battle} roll against the defender. Add the modifiers below as appropriate to each roll.</p><table><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Battle Modifiers</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Modifier</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Circumstance</th></tr><tr><td><p>+1 per<br />point of<br />advantage</p></td><td><p><strong>Force Bonus:</strong> The side with the most Force Tokens adds +1 for each point of difference.

Casualties are generally distributed evenly throughout the army or however the DM feels is most appropriate for the narrative.</p><p><strong>Time:</strong> A standard battle round is two hours of hard fighting.

When used in this way, Persuasion isn’t a single exchange but several hours of networking, hobnobbing, carousing, drinks, gifts, bribes, or entertaining. This might represent time roaming a marketplace, a series of meetings with important people, or an evening of food and drink.</p><p>Success grants most of what the character wants, though it may take a while, cost some money, or require a favor in return. A @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} either gets more of whatever he was looking for, or at a lower cost.</p><p>Failure means the hero’s efforts are in vain. A @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} means he’s cut off from that particular group for a while (up to the DM but typically about a week).</p><p><strong>Money Talks:</strong> You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar, the saying goes. A character with a little lucre to spread around gets a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Reroll]{reroll} on her networking attempt, spending money on better bribes, gifts, or wining and dining her contacts.</p><p>The amount required is up to the GM, the location, and the nature of the contact(s) she interacts with. As a rule of thumb, use the expenses listed under <span>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Downtime]{Carousing}</span> and modify as appropriate from there.</p><h3>Intimidation (The Not-so-Nice Way)</h3><p>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Intimidation]{Intimidation} can also be used to gather information, call in favors, or make demands, but it’s a little less savory.</p><p>Each attempt to \"work the streets\" takes several hours of threats and general unpleasantness, rousting the local populace for whatever the hero needs.</p><p>Success grants the character most of what she wants, though her victims might decide to get some payback later on. A raise means she gets more info, gets it faster, or her victims are too scared or otherwise preoccupied to plot revenge.</p><p>Failure means the bully doesn’t get anything useful. A @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} means she ends the evening with a fat lip, black eye, or broken nose (see <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps and Bruises}</strong>). She can work her contacts again the next day, but they’re more likely to be waiting for her this time!</p><p><strong>Busting Heads:</strong> The bruiser can improve her odds by getting more violent or extreme than usual. This alienates her contacts for a week but grants her a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Reroll]{reroll} on the Intimidation check.</p><p>This raises the stakes as well. A simple failure means the evening ends with <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps and Bruises}</strong>. A Critical Failure bears more serious consequences. The DM might break the action down to an actual encounter (which might be an ambush!). The hero might run afoul of the law, come back with two levels of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} from Bumps &amp; Bruises, or her questions might trigger a deadly reaction from a more powerful enemy!</p><h2 class=\"example\">Example: Savage Measures</h2><p>Amiri the barbarian needs to locate a town official held for ransom by nefarious bandits.

Instead, the DM describes the scene, and then the players agree on a general plan and what their characters will do to resolve the situation.</p><p>Once all the players state their intent, they pick the skill that best represents their actions during the encounter and roll. Here are some common examples:</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Combat:</span> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill}.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Crisis:</span> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} (to calm bystanders), @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Repair]{Repair}.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Heist:</span> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery}.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Mission:</span> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Battle]{Battle}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Boating]{Boating}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Trek:</span> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Survival]{Survival}.</li></ul><p><strong>Modifiers:</strong> The DM should assign modifiers based on the situation. If the heroes greatly outnumber their opposition, pursue much slower prey, have prior experience with the obstacles in their path, or special equipment to deal with hazards, the roll might be made at +1 to +4.</p><p>Very difficult encounters, such as powerful foes (relative to the party), faster prey, or extreme conditions inflict a −1 to −4 penalty.</p><h3>Turn Order &amp; Critical Actions</h3><p>Players can go in whatever order they want in a Quick Encounter. This might be important if some of their actions are dependent on someone else's. In a heist, for example, the group might depend on a smooth-talker to gather information about the target's security before the thief attempts to break in. Similarly, a battle commander might need to send a scout across enemy lines before sending in a team to sabotage the enemy's war engine.</p><p>Resolve these kinds of actions in the order that makes sense, and allow those who come after to change their own plans as the situation changes.</p><p>If a critical task is failed, the DM must decide if it stops the encounter or simply complicates it (perhaps inflicting a penalty to everyone else's roll). In the heist example above, for example, maybe the charmer gets the information but tips off someone who adds extra sentries, inflicting a −2 penalty to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth} or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} rolls. Likewise, the scout might find the war engine's location but the enemy moves the device shortly thereafter, adding the need for additional reconnaissance for the team of saboteurs.</p><p>These kinds of complications might also mean resolving the encounter in multiple stages instead of one roll as the heroes must react to the changing circumstances (see <strong>Staged Encounters,</strong> below).</p><h3>Staged Encounters</h3><p>Quick Encounters are typically a single die roll followed by some narration between the DM and the players. But some encounters might need additional rounds to better reflect the results or any new information or events that come to light.</p><p>If the heist to break into a wizard's tower and steal a powerful occult artifact goes badly, for example, the next stage might become a crisis when the tower suddenly bursts into supernatural flames. That might then lead to a combat encounter as an artifact in the wizard's study breaks and releases an angry djinn!</p><p>The beauty of staged encounters is their ability to handle complex problems when the constraints of time or larger narrative require a speedy resolution.</p><h2>Encounter Results</h2><p>Once each player has determined her skill and any modifiers, she rolls the dice and works with the Dungeon Master to narrate the details based on the total, the situation, and the other players' actions.</p><h3>Dangerous Encounters</h3><p>If a character fails his roll in a dangerous situation he takes a @UUID[JournalEntry.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#damage-effects]{Wound} (or d4 Wounds with a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure}). If he's the driver of a vehicle, it takes a Wound (or d4 with a Critical Failure). Wounds may be @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#soak-rolls]{Soaked} as usual.</p><p>Success means the hero emerges with only <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps and Bruises}</strong>, and a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} means he escapes unscathed.</p><h3>Nonlethal Encounters</h3><p>If the encounter isn't physically dangerous, failure means the hero doesn't contribute to the party's overall success somehow. @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} means she suffers social stigma, loses or breaks a piece of vital equipment, is positively identified, or gets the wrong information. This likely means moving on to a second stage of the encounter as she deals with the fallout of her errors.</p><h3>Success &amp; Failure</h3><p>In general, narration and individual actions determine the success or failure of an encounter. If the smooth-talker can't learn the habits of the sentries, for example, and the DM decides this fact shuts down the operation rather than complicating it, the encounter fails. In other words, let the story tell the tale.</p><p>In a more dynamic situation such as combat, assume the group \"wins\" if there are at least as many total successes (one for each success and raise) as there are player characters. They get the information, drive off their foes, complete the mission, or avert (or escape) the crisis. @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support} rolls <em>don't</em> count as successes.</p><p>If there are fewer successes than player characters, they fail. Specifics are up to the Dungeon Master, but this might mean the party has to fall back or retreat from their foes, their prey escapes, they don't get the object or information they sought, they survive the crisis but can't save most of the bystanders, and so on.</p><p>If they can try again, the DM should \"reset\" the encounter with the new narrative so the group has to come up with a new plan. And of course, their foes are likely on to them now!</p><h3>Ammo &amp; Power Points</h3><p>Use the rules for <strong>Ammo &amp; Power Points</strong> under <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Mass Battles]{Mass Battles}</strong> for combat encounters if desired. Otherwise the player and DM can just decide what resources were consumed in the encounter.</p><h2 class=\"example\">Example: Night on the prowl</h2><p>Our heroes must break into a nobleman's library, steal an ancient book, and stop an evil conspiracy that threatens all of Eberron.</p><p>The group decides to play out the break-in as a Quick Encounter. The rogue plans to use @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} to break into the library, take the manuscript, then escape out the back. The bard supports her with a diversionary recital in the town square.</p><p>The DM decides the rogue's Thievery roll is at −2 to get into the library. The bard gets a success with his @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Performance]{Performance} to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support}. He adds +1 to his friend's roll.</p><p>The rogue manages a single success, but since there are two player characters and the rules say they need at least as many successes as there are characters, they fail.</p><p>The DM says three of the nobleman's guards are alerted by the pair's actions. The heroes can continue if they want, but the encounter is now more difficult (−2). The DM also says it's now a Dangerous Encounter as the guards are armed and nervous.</p><p>With the fate of Eberron at stake, the party agrees to press on. The rogue now uses @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth} to avoid the guards. The bard disguises himself and knocks on the door, pretending to be lost! The DM tells the bard to use Performance for this Support roll. He rolls a 21!

In this chapter we show you how to make basic skill and attribute checks—and make your combats Fast, Furious, and Fun!</p><h2>Wild Cards &amp; Extras</h2><p>Your hero (a player character), and unique allies, villains, and monsters are collectively called “Wild Cards.” These beings have a better chance at doing things, are a little tougher to put down, and are generally more detailed than common guards, minions, or lackeys—collectively called “Extras.”</p><p>Wild Cards are noted with a design of some sort before their name.</p><h3 class=\"dragon-icon\">Goblin Warchanter</h3><p>In <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> the Wild Card symbol is a distinctive dragon head.</p><p>Player characters are always Wild Cards. The Dungeon Master must decide which of her nonplayer characters and monsters are Wild Cards. The sergeant of the City Watch probably isn’t a Wild Card, but Sergeant Grimlock of the City Watch may be. Skytch the Dragon is also a Wild Card, though his three young wyrms aren’t.</p><p>Wild Cards are those who have stepped up to do more than most. They dare, aspire, and risk it all to be a hero—or a villain!</p><p>They have two special abilities in the game:</p><ul><li>Wild Cards can take three @UUID[JournalEntry.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#damage-effects]{Wounds} before they’re @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Incapacitation]{Incapacitated}.</li><li>Wild Cards roll a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die} (usually a d6) along with their skill or attribute die when making @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait rolls} and take the highest of the two as their total.</li></ul><h2>Trait Rolls</h2><p>To make a skill or attribute “check” or “roll,” simply roll the die assigned to it. If the result is a 4 or better (the “Target Number” or TN), the action is successful. For example, if a character’s Strength is a d6, he rolls a six-sided die. On a 4 or better, he’s successful.</p><p><strong>Modifiers:</strong> Circumstances modify the die roll, such as shooting at something far away or finding a well-hidden clue. Some things, such as ranged attacks, have standard modifiers. It’s up to the DM to determine any modifiers for more subjective tasks, such as spotting an ambush or eavesdropping on a conversation through a door.</p><p>In general, an easy task, such as finding tracks in the mud, is made at +2. A difficult task, such as finding tracks by torchlight, is made at −2. A very difficult task, such as finding tracks in a rainstorm, is made at −4.</p><p><strong>Multiple Dice:</strong> When a character rolls multiple dice, such as when firing two arrows with the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Rapid Shot]{Rapid Shot} Edge, check each die separately.</p><h3>Wild Die</h3><p>Extras roll a single die when making a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait roll}. @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Cards} roll an extra d6 and take the highest of their Trait die or the “Wild Die.” Both of these dice can Ace (see below).</p><p><strong>One Wild Die Per Action:</strong> When Wild Cards roll multiple dice for a single action, they roll only one Wild Die. It may replace a Trait die or be ignored—it never adds another action or attack to the roll.</p><p class=\"example\"><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> A fighter has the <em><strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Frenzy]{Frenzy}</strong></em> Edge. He rolls an extra Fighting die when making a melee attack along with a Wild Die. Only two of his dice can cause hits since the Wild Die can only replace a die, not add another attack.</p><h3>Aces</h3><p>All @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Trait} and damage rolls in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> are open-ended. That means that when you roll the highest number possible on a die (a 6 on a d6, an 8 on a d8, and so on), you get to roll that die again and add it to the total. This is called an “Ace.” Any modifiers to the die roll should be tacked on after adding up an Aced roll.</p><p class=\"example\"><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> A rogue attempts to leap a dangerous ice chasm. She’s a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} with a d8 in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}, so she rolls a d8 and a d6 and takes the highest result. In this case, both dice Ace (8 on the d8 and 6 on the d6). She rolls the d8 again and gets a 4 for a total of 12 on the d8. She rolls the d6 again and gets another 6, followed by a 2—that’s a total of 14 on the Wild Die. The wily rogue leaps the chasm with ease!</p><h3>Raises</h3><p>Sometimes it’s important to know just how successful a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait roll} was. Every 4 points over the Target Number is called a “raise.” If your hero needs a 4 to shoot an opponent and rolls an 11, he hits with a raise. Figure raises after adjusting for any modifiers.</p><p>A raise always provides an additional effect of some sort, such as bonus damage when attacking or a benefit determined by the DM for other rolls.</p><h3>Opposed Rolls</h3><p>Sometimes rolls are “opposed” by an opponent. The attacker gets a @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Trait} total, then the defender attempts to beat it.</p><p>The exact skills or attributes used in a contest are specified in each circumstance, or the DM can decide what makes the most sense. If two characters try to pull something from each other’s hands, for example, they make opposed Strength rolls. Sneaking up on someone is a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth} roll opposed by @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}.</p><p>The acting character in an opposed roll always makes the Trait total first (including spending any <strong>@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies}</strong>), and must get at least a basic success (TN 4) or he fails. The defender rolls next and must <em>meet</em> or <em>exceed</em> the first character’s result or the attacker wins.</p><p>The winner also uses the opponent’s total for purposes of determining raise effects.</p><h3>Critical Failures</h3><p>A Critical Failure occurs when a Wild Card rolls a 1 on both the skill die and Wild Die of a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait roll}. The attempt automatically fails and something bad happens—a weapon is dropped or gets stuck, the attack hits a friend, the vehicle crashes, spells misfire (see <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Backlash]{Backlash}</strong>), and so on.</p><p>Critical Failures cannot be rerolled by any means, even with <strong>@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies}</strong>.</p><p><strong>Extras and Critical Failures:</strong> If an Extra rolls a 1 on a Trait check <em>and it’s important to know if it’s a Critical Failure</em>, such as when casting a spell, roll a d6. On a 1, it’s a Critical Failure. Otherwise it’s just a normal failure.</p><p><strong>Multiple Dice:</strong> Some abilities allow characters to roll multiple Trait dice, such as the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Frenzy]{Frenzy} Edge or firing a weapon with a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Rate of Fire]{Rate of Fire} higher than 1. A Critical Failure with multiple dice occurs when more than half the die results are a natural 1. If the character is a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}, the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die} <em>must</em> be a 1 as well.</p><p class=\"example\"><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> A fighter with the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Frenzy]{Frenzy} Edge rolls two @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} dice and one @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die}. If two or more of the dice come up 1s, including the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die}, it’s a Critical Failure.</p><h3>Unskilled Attempts</h3><p>If a character doesn’t have a skill for an action he’s attempting, he rolls a d4 for his skill die (and a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die} if a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}) and subtracts 2 from the total.</p><p>The DM may decide certain tasks cannot be attempted unskilled, such as repairing a steam engine or piloting an airship.</p><h3>Reroll</h3><p>Some Edges or abilities allow a character to reroll @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Trait} (as long as they’re not a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure}). To do so, roll <em>all</em> the dice again and get a new total. You may keep any set you like <em>unless</em> you roll a Critical Failure. This ends all rerolls immediately and becomes the result of the attempt—that’s the risk one takes in pushing the limits!</p><p>Multiple rerolls may be granted from different @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edges}, @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies}, or other abilities.</p><h3>Group Rolls</h3><p>When the DM wants to make a Trait roll for a group of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Extras} with like @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Traits}, roll one Trait die as usual along with a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die} and treat this as the group’s result. This gives a decent average without making rolls for every individual.</p><p class=\"example\"><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> A group of soldiers attempts to pass by an enemy encampment. The DM rolls their @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth} die (a d6) and a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Die]{Wild Die} and takes the best of the two as the soldiers’ total.</p><h2>Bennies</h2><p>Every now and then, dice rolls may not work in your favor. That’s why <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> gives players a little control over their hero’s fate.</p><h3>Player Character Bennies</h3><p>Players start each game session with three “@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies}” (American slang for “benefits”), represented by poker chips, gaming stones, the official @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies} we make for all of our games, or other tokens that signify a little bit of good luck or fate. @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies} are discarded at the end of each session—use them or lose them!</p><p><strong>Combat:</strong> If a session ends in the middle of combat or other dramatic event, wait until it’s resolved in the next session before giving out new @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies}.</p><p><strong>GM Rewards:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies} are earned during the game in two ways:</p><ul><li><p><span class=\"list-heading\">Awards:</span> The Dungeon Master should occasionally reward players for clever actions, roleplaying their character (especially any Hindrances), or great feats of heroism.<br />She can also award players a Benny for telling a great story in character, delivering a fantastic line that makes everyone laugh, or creating an emotional moment.</p></li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Joker’s Wild:</span> When a player character draws a Joker during combat, <em>all</em> player characters receive a Benny! If the players get both Jokers everyone gets <em>two</em> Bennies!</li></ul><h3>Dungeon Master Bennies</h3><p>Dungeon Masters start each session with a pool of one Benny per player character. These may be used by any of her characters (including non-Wild Cards!).</p><p>The DM's Wild Cards also have Bennies of their own, a base of three modified by their Edges and Hindrances. They can use these or any of the Bennies in the common pool as the DM wishes.</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Joker’s Wild:</span> Anytime the villains draw a Joker, put one Benny in their general pool and give another to each enemy @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card}.</li></ul><h3>Using Bennies</h3><p>Bennies may be spent at any appropriate time and don’t incur any sort of penalty. They may only be used for your own character.</p><p>Here are the ways players can use Bennies.</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Reroll a Trait:</span> Bennies grant a hero a reroll on <em>any</em> Trait (see <strong>Rerolls,</strong> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Reroll]{here}).</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Recover from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Shaken]{Shaken}:</span> This is instant and may be done at any time, even interrupting another’s actions if desired.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Recover Power Points:</span> A character with an Arcane Background, Mystic Powers, or any other ability that grants @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Power Points]{Power Points} can spend a Benny as a free action to recover five Power Points.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Soak Rolls:</span> Bennies can be used to prevent @UUID[JournalEntry.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#damage-effects]{Wounds} or recover from being Shaken.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Draw a New @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#action-cards-(initiative)]{Action Card}:</span> When the game is in rounds, a character can spend a Benny to get a new <strong>@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#action-cards-(initiative)]{Action Cards}</strong>. This occurs after all cards are dealt and Edges or Hindrances like @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Quick]{Quick}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Level Headed]{Level Headed}, or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Hesitant]{Hesitant} are resolved. <em>Then</em> players or the DM may spend Bennies for an additional card as many times as they like and take their choice of all their draws. Edges like Quick or Level Headed <em>do not</em> apply to these additional cards drawn with Bennies. This continues until everyone (including the GM) passes. Then the round begins and no further cards may be drawn.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Reroll Damage:</span> You may spend a Benny to reroll damage. Include any additional dice you may have gained for a raise on the attack roll.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Influence the Story:</span> This one is entirely up to the Dungeon Master, who may allow a character to spend a Benny to find an additional clue if you’re stuck, come up with some mundane but needed item, or push a nonplayer character into being a bit more agreeable.</li></ul><p class=\"example\"><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> The party is adrift on a storm-tossed sea. None of the characters purchased navigational equipment, but Harsk the ranger had been aiding their doomed captain through the previous encounters. Harsk's player asks the Dungeon Master if he might have been given his own compass and maps while aiding the captain, and might still have them in his bag. The DM agrees—for a @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Benny}. Harsk suddenly remembers the tools in his pack and turns the boat toward shore.</p><p> </p><aside class=\"sidebar\"><h2>Awarding Bennies</h2><p>It takes a few games to figure out how many @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies} you should award players during a session. In general, we recommend you be fairly free with them, especially early in the game. If someone makes everyone laugh (and isn’t distracting the flow of the game), toss the player a Benny. When players roleplay a Hindrance, reward them. When someone does something clever or heroic or imaginative, acknowledge it with a Benny.</p><p>Some GMs worry the game will become too easy if Bennies are too common, but we find the opposite is true. When Bennies are plentiful, players often spend them on trivial things that are important to <em>them</em>. Maybe the rogue <em>really</em> wants to pick the lock on a chest. There’s nothing particularly valuable inside and the player probably knows it, but the character is the <em>rogue</em> and wants to prove it to the rest of the party.</p><p>When Bennies are scarce, however, players tend to save them for injuries, death, or taking out the big bads. That’s fine, but takes away from the fun and heroics that got them to this point. <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is about big action and players should be encouraged to take chances. The “currency” of these chances are those Bennies.</p><p>Veteran <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> GMs might also notice Bennies tend to flow fairly fast early on in a session. The group is settling in, laughing, and are rewarded for roleplaying their Hindrances the first time or two. In the mid-to-late game, Bennies tend to be spent faster than they’re gained. That’s a fantastic pace. It gives the heroes opportunities to do big things in the early and mid-game then forces some critical resource management for the final showdown.</p><p>If you find yourself being stingy, go the other way the next time you run and see how it affects your group. Then you’ll know what’s right for you and your friends.</p></aside><h2>Conviction</h2><p>Conviction is a special award granted when a character experiences a great and meaningful victory; or a painful and catastrophic misfortune. Either drives the hero to increase her efforts, giving her inner strength she can draw on in the most desperate situations.</p><p>Like @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Bennies}, players should receive a physical token of some sort to note their Conviction. The tokens can be spent at any time to add a d6 to all the character’s Trait and damage totals until the beginning of her next turn. This die can @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aces]{Ace}, and its result is added to the final total.</p><div><img style=\"padding:1%\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/general/sorrowful-regret.webp\" /></div><p>Conviction tokens don't stack, but the bonus may be maintained from round to round by spending a Benny at the start of the character's turn. Once Conviction lapses, however, the effect ends.</p><p>Conviction tokens aren’t Bennies and can’t be used as such. They <em>are</em> kept between sessions, however, and a hero can have more than one Conviction token at a time.</p><p><strong>Refresh:</strong> A hero may also spend Conviction to trigger or refresh abilities that are usually only usable once per session, day, encounter, and so on, even if they’ve already been used.</p><h2 class=\"example\">Example: Tragedy &amp; Triumph</h2><p>Seelah the paladin of Iomedae and her companions signed on to escort a caravan from Turtleback Ferry to Sandpoint. Over the course of the journey, they made friends with the caravanners. Seelah became particularly close with a young girl she thought of as a daughter, Julia.</p><p>Then tragedy struck. A savage and brutal band of ogres descended from the hills and attacked the caravan. Seelah and her friends tore into the ogres with savage ferocity, but when the dust settled, Julia was found dead.</p><p>Given her close relationship with the girl, the Dungeon Master decides Seelah's player gains @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Conviction]{Conviction}. The paladin burns with rage at the murderous ogres and chastises herself for failing to protect her friend.</p><p>Later on, the party corners the ogres' chief in his hilltop fortress. Seelah personally defeats the brute in single combat and avenges Julia's death. The Dungeon Master decides the paladin's triumph is also worthy of Conviction.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Combat","type":"text","_id":"5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\"><div><h1 class=\"wide\">Combat</h1></div><p>Whether they’re the burning plains of the Cinderlands or the cursed battlefield of the Plain of Ten Thousand Swords—these are <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> and they are often violent.</p><p>The rest of this chapter tells you how great heroes and terrible monsters battle in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>. The combat rules are designed for use with miniatures or pawns by default, but it’s easy to use these concepts when you’re playing without them.</p><p><strong>Distance:</strong> Because the game assumes you are using terrain or a battlemat and standard 28mm miniatures, movement and weapon ranges are listed in inches. To translate that to regular distance, one inch equals two yards.</p><p>If you’re using miniatures and need to accommodate a larger battlefield, simply set each inch as five or 10 yards, for example, and adjust movement and ranges appropriately.</p><p><strong>Time:</strong> When a fight breaks out, game time breaks down into rounds of about six seconds each. Ten rounds equal one minute.</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Round:</span> A “round” is an entire countdown of @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#action-cards-(initiative)]{Action Cards}, from the Ace to the Deuce (Two).</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Turn:</span> A character’s “turn” occurs when his Action Card comes up in the countdown. A hero with the Six of Diamonds, for example, takes his turn when that card comes up in the round.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Action:</span> A single attack, skill use, etc. Characters may perform multiple actions on their turn (see <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Multi-Actions]{Multi-Actions}</strong>).</li></ul><h2>Action Cards (Initiative)</h2><p>The action in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is fast and furious. To help the Dungeon Master keep track of who goes in what order and add a little randomness to the game, we use a single deck of playing cards with both Jokers left in to determine everyone’s initiative order. We call these “Action Cards.”</p><p>The DM can deal cards face up or face down as she sees fit. She might also deal the players’ cards face up and the villains face down to increase the players’ tension and uncertainty!</p><p>At the start of each round:</p><ul><li>Deal each @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} an Action Card (plus any extra cards for @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edges}). @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Allies]{Allies} under a player’s control act on his Action Card.</li><li>Groups of nonplayer characters and creatures, such as all @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Zombie, Human]{zombies}, all @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Dog/wolf]{wolves}, and so on, should share an Action Card so they act together. This breaks each group up a bit for dramatic purposes and game balance and keeps things easy for the Dungeon Master to manage.</li></ul><p><strong>Shuffle:</strong> Shuffle the deck after any round in which a Joker was dealt.</p><p><strong>Large Groups:</strong> In very large groups or time-sensitive games, the Dungeon Master can deal a single card per side (heroes and villains). On the heroes’ turn, simply start at one end of the group and work quickly around. This speeds things up if that’s more important than varying initiative order. If one or more characters have @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Level Headed]{Level Headed} or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Quick]{Quick}, let that apply to the draw (but only once).</p><h2>Actions</h2><p>Characters perform “actions” when their @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#action-cards-(initiative)]{Action Card} comes up each round. This is their “turn.” A character can move (see <strong>@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#movement]{Movement}</strong>, below) and perform one regular action at any point in her movement, attacking, casting a spell, and so on, without penalty.</p><p>Characters can choose from a multitude of actions on their turn. Common actions include @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Supporting} allies, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Test]{Testing} foes, using a power, or attacking with @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting}. See <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Multi-Actions]{Multi-Actions}</strong> to perform more than one action per turn (though only one of these can be a limited action).</p><p>More complex actions like lighting a torch or digging through a backpack might require more than a round to complete (DM's call).</p><h2>Movement</h2><p>Characters can move a number of tabletop inches equal to their Pace each turn, and may freely set their facing as they do so.</p><p>Each inch of movement spent climbing, crawling, or swimming uses 2″ of Pace.</p><p><strong>Running:</strong> A hero can “run” as a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Free Actions]{free action} once per turn, increasing her Pace for the round by her running die (a d6 by default) at the cost of a −2 penalty to all other actions that turn. Running dice never @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aces]{Ace}. (The running die is random to account for nuances of terrain not depicted on the tabletop and for the “risk to reward” decision players must make.)</p><p>Out of combat situations, a character can move twice the sum of her full Pace + maximum running die for a number of minutes equal to half her Vigor die type. Thus a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Fleet-Footed]{Fleet-Footed} character with Vigor d6 can sprint at a Pace of 32 for three minutes.</p><p><strong>Difficult Ground:</strong> Each inch a hero moves over rough terrain such as thick forest, up or down a steep incline, slippery ice, etc., counts as 2″ of her Pace. Crawling is unaffected by Difficult Ground.</p><p><strong>Hazards:</strong> If the DM feels movement is hazardous for some reason—climbing under duress, swimming a fast-moving river, walking a tightrope—she can require an @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} roll to move. Success means she continues on normally. Failure means she can’t move. With a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} the character takes @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} from <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps and Bruises}</strong>, falls if climbing or in a precarious position (see <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Falling]{Falling}</strong>), or drowns if swimming (see <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Drowning]{Drowning}</strong>) both in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Hazards]{Hazards}.</p><h2>Attacks</h2><p>The basics of fast, furious combat are discussed in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Melee Attacks]{Melee Attacks} and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Ranged Attacks]{Ranged Attacks}. Many additional options and situations are covered under <strong>Situational Rules</strong> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Situational Rules]{here}.</p><h2>Damage</h2><p>After a successful melee or ranged hit, the attacker rolls damage. Ranged weapons do fixed damage as listed in the @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.QKA6dagfLDYyCUh6.JournalEntryPage.kYcSTPeASQ45iHrC]{Gear} section. Most bows, for example, cause 2d6 damage.</p><p>Hand weapons cause damage equal to the attacker’s @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Strength} die plus a second die, which depends on the weapon. A barbarian with a d12 Strength and a long sword (d8 damage) rolls d12+d8 damage. Add the rolls on the damage dice together to get the damage total.</p><p>Even though Strength is used to determine melee damage, this isn’t a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{Trait roll} so @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Cards} don’t add a Wild Die to the roll.</p><p>All damage rolls can @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Aces]{Ace}.</p><p><strong>Unarmed Damage:</strong> An unarmed combatant rolls only his @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Strength} die unless he has an @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edge} like <strong>\"@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Brawler]{Brawler}</strong> that grants him a damage die.</p><h2>Damage Effects</h2><p>Damage can result in three effects: Shaken, Woounds, and Incapacitation.</p><h3>Shaken</h3><p>Shaken characters are nicked, bruised, or otherwise rattled. They may only take free actions, such as moving (including running). At the start of their turn, Shaken characters must attempt to recover from being Shaken by making a Spirit roll. This is a free action.</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Failure:</span> The character remains Shaken. She can only perform free actions.</li><li>Success: The character is no longer Shaken and may act normally.</li></ul><p><strong>Bennies:</strong> A player may spend a Benny at any time to remove her Shaken status (even when it’s not her turn).</p><h3>Wounds</h3><p>Every raise on the damage roll inflicts a Wound. Extras are Incapacitated if they take a single Wound (and aren’t <strong>Resilient</strong>). They’re dead, injured, or otherwise out of the fight.</p><p>Wild Cards can take three Wounds and still function (more with certain Edges or abilities). Further damage doesn’t cause additional Wounds but Incapacitates them instead.</p><p><strong>Wound Penalties:</strong> Each Wound a character suffers causes a −1 cumulative penalty to his Pace (minimum of 1″) and all Trait rolls--up to a maximum penalty of −3.</p><p><strong>Timing:</strong> Characters sometimes take multi­ple hits on the same Action Card. Resolve each damage roll separately before moving on to the next (including any Soak rolls).</p><h3>Wound Cap</h3><p>In <cite>Savage Pathfinder</cite>, characters can never suffer more than four Wounds in a single hit and therefore never have to Soak more than four wounds either. This rule keeps combat dangerous but reduces the chances of heroes (and villains!) dying from a single lucky blow. It can still happen, but it is far more rare.</p><p>Ignore the cap for catastrophic damage such as falls from great heights, extreme environments such as lava, and so on.</p><p><strong>Large Creatures:</strong> The Wound Cap still applies to large or Resilient creatures with more than three Wounds. A Huge dragon that can take five Wounds before being @UUID[Compendium.swpf-core-rules.swpf-rules.swpfcore03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03combat00000000]{Incapacitated}, for example, can’t take more than four from a single attack, so it can’t be killed with a single attack even if it fails to Soak.</p><h3>Incapacitation</h3><p>Incapacitated characters may not perform actions but are still dealt Action Cards for the remainder of the encounter in case they recover or must roll for other effects such as <strong>Bleeding Out</strong> (below). Edges or Hindrances that affect card draws, such as Quick, Level Headed, or Hesitant are ignored when the hero is Incapacitated.</p><p>If Incapacitated by damage or injury, he must make an immediate Vigor roll:</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Critical Failure:</span> The character dies.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Failure:</span> Roll on the <strong>Injury Table</strong>. The Injury is permanent and the character is <strong>Bleeding Out</strong>, see Bleeding Out below.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Success:</span> Roll on the <strong>Injury Table</strong>. The Injury goes away when all Wounds are healed.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Raise:</span> Roll on the <strong>Injury Table</strong>. The Injury goes away in 24 hours, or when all Wounds are healed (whichever is sooner).</li></ul><p>Characters cannot take actions of any kind and might be unconscious (GM’s call). The victim makes a Vigor roll each day thereafter and is no longer Incapacitated(or unconscious) if successful. They may also heal Wounds during this time (see <strong>Natural Healing</strong>).</p><p><strong>Bleeding Out:</strong> The injured character is dying and must make a Vigor roll at the start of his turn. Failure means he perishes. With success he survives but must roll again next turn (or every minute if not in combat). With a raise, he stabilizes and no further rolls are required.</p><p>Other characters may stop a victim’s bleeding by making a Healing roll (the @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Healing]{Healing}{skill} or the spell). This is an action, and if successful the patient is stabilized.</p><p>The <em>@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Healing]{Healing}{healing}</em> power can also stabilize Wounds, as can a successful “natural” healing roll by a being with regeneration of some sort.</p><p><strong>Incapacitation from @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.OPSttc2CAS2LC1ju.JournalEntryPage.7LJ6PoYcYzg4lThm]{Fatigue}</strong></p><aside class=\"sidebar\"><h2>More on Shaken</h2><p>Figuring out how Shaken and Wounds work together takes a little getting used to, but is worth it for the game play it provides.

This encourages creativity and allows any character to access arcane powers on occasion (though at significant cost).</p><p>If a setting is relatively low-magic, it also makes even the most basic spells feel special and magical, such as boosting the party's Vigor for a day while they cross the Great Desert.</p><p>Remember that the party must have the spell or find the “ritual” to cast it, so if the DM doesn't want them to have access to something unknown she doesn't have to let them find it!</p><p>Finally, note that the mystic intervention power must be cast via ritual magic.

The <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> rules allow you to create most anything.</p><h2>Species</h2><p>This core rule book comes with nineteen recommended species to use when creating player characters. See species for more info @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.WlhfcDVcVAW85lfa]{here}.</p><h2>Hindrances</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.71p7h2rERyAUfpmt]{Hindrances} are flaws, drawbacks, or dark secrets drawn from a character’s backstory. They provide up to four additional “Hindrance points” you can use to enhance your hero during character creation.</p><p>Taking Hindrances not only helps you define and roleplay your hero, but also allows you to increase his @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{attribute or skill} points, take @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edges}, or have additional gold to buy better adventuring gear.</p><p>A Major @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.71p7h2rERyAUfpmt]{Hindrance} is worth 2 Hindrance points, and a Minor is worth 1. A hero could thus take two Major Hindrances, four Minor, or any combination that adds up to 4 character points. (You can take <em>more</em> Hindrances if you want but the maximum benefit is 4 points!)</p><p><strong>For 2 Hindrance points you can:</strong></p><ul class=\"bullet\"><li>Raise an attribute one die type, or</li><li>Choose an Edge</li></ul><p><strong>For 1 Hindrance point you can:</strong></p><ul class=\"bullet\"><li>Gain another skill point, or</li><li>Start play with an additional 600 gold pieces.</li></ul><h2>Traits</h2><p>Characters are defined by attributes and skills, collectively called “Traits.” Attributes and skills are ranked by die types, typically from d4 to d12, with d6 being the average for adult humans. Higher is better!</p><p>Attributes typically govern how fast your skills can increase, and are used for passive effects such as resisting spells or recovering from injuries.</p><h3>Attributes</h3><p>Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, and Vigor (discussed in more detail in @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Traits}).</p><p>You then have 5 character points to increase your attributes. Raising a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point.</p><p><strong>Attribute Limit:</strong> No attribute may be raised above a d12 unless an ancestral ability or @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edge} says otherwise. Each increase beyond a d12 adds a +1 modifier. Increasing a d12 Strength two steps or “die types,” for example, gives your hero a @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Strength} score of d12+2.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Skills are learned abilities such as firing weapons, hand-to-hand combat, scientific knowledge, professional aptitudes, and so on.</p><p>Skills in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> are very broad to keep the action simple and straightforward. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} skill, for example, covers all types of bows and crossbows. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} skill covers thrown weapons, as well as grappling, swimming, and climbing. Detailed customization comes in the form of @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edges}.</p><p><strong>Core Skills:</strong> Five skills are marked with a red star in the list for skills in @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Traits}: <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}</strong>, and <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}</strong>. These are “innate” abilities most adult adventurers have.

If you exceed the linked attribute, the cost becomes 2 points per die type.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Your character starts with Common and knows additional languages equal to half her @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Smarts} die type. Typical choices are listed with each ancestry. See Languages in @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Traits} for more information.</p><p><strong>Skill Limit:</strong> Skills may not be increased above d12 during character creation unless the character’s ancestry starts with the skill at d6. If the skill starts with a d6, increase her maximum to d12+1. Elves in @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.WlhfcDVcVAW85lfa]{Races} start with a d6 in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, for example, which means their Notice skill may be increased to d12+1.</p><h2>Derived Statistics</h2><p>Your character sheet contains a few other statistics you need to fill in, described below.</p><p><strong>Pace</strong> is how fast your character moves in tactical situations like combat. Standard Pace is 6, which means six tabletop inches per game round. Each inch is two yards (6 feet) in the real world. <strong>@UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#movement]{Movement}</strong> is explained in detail in @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe]{Combat}.</p><p><strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry}</strong> is equal to 2 plus half your character’s @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} die type (a total of 2 if a character doesn’t have Fighting), plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. This is the Target Number (TN) to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>For Fighting skills higher than d12, such as d12+1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded down. For instance, Fighting d12+1 grants a Parry of 8, while Fighting d12+2 results in a Parry of 9.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> A hero’s default @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} is 0 unless altered by ancestral abilities, @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edges}, or @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.71p7h2rERyAUfpmt]{Hindrances}. It cannot be less than −1 or more than +3.</p><p><strong>Toughness</strong> is your hero’s damage thres­hold.

Maybe your characters know each other right from the start. Or you might collectively decide to optimize your group a bit and ensure you’ve got a good assortment of skills and abilities. If so, make sure you’re playing what you want to play. There’s no point in being the party’s healer if that’s not a role you care to play.</p><h3>Deities and alignment</h3><p>The conflict between Good and Evil is a core theme of any <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> game. Typically, heroes fight for Good, but not always.</p><p>Alignments in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> indicate the general moral compass of a person, creature or organization. Where alignment is listed, it is a tool for the Dungeon Master to identify the broad outlook of that entity, and how it may interact with others, including the adventurers. When choosing an alignment for your character, you decide what ethical path he will follow, guided by the @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edges} and @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.71p7h2rERyAUfpmt]{Hindrances} you chose to define him. Unless your DM specifically agrees, you cannot choose Evil as your alignment.</p><p>Some character concepts require choosing a deity or “Domain” that governs powers and certain abilities. Likewise, the player’s choice of Hindrances can involve a Deity or a cause, such as @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Vow]{Vow} or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Code of Honor]{Code of Honor}. Deities have a listed alignment, either Good, Neutral, or Evil to indicate the general philosophy of the deity and her followers. Of course, adherents to a particular faith might not necessarily share the same outlook as the deity's alignment. Terrible deeds might be perpetrated in the name of a good or merciful god. You can find more information on domains and deities in the @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.MAcvE2WNI1eEy4R8]{Edges} section.</p></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"ZGzSJDQJ4G0PdLnd","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Species","type":"text","_id":"WlhfcDVcVAW85lfa","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"swpf-core\"><h1 class=\"wide\">Species</h1><p><cite>Savage Eberron </cite>includes nineteen recommended species for use in character creation, along with abilities that reflect the most common or iconic virtues and drawbacks of each.</p><p>Note that the following descriptions allude to a lot of rules we haven’t explained yet.

Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Known as <em>guul'dar</em>, or \"strong people\", among the <em>dar</em> or goblin races. <em>Guul'dar</em> are born for battle and mayhem being fierce and aggressive. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despite being bossed around. In Darguun they living in tribes in the Marguul mountains, or in the <em>ghaal'dur </em>tribes ruling Darguun often serving as shock troops being ruled by the hobgoblins with superior numbers and intellect.</p><h3>The Marguul</h3><p>The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the <em>ghaal'dar</em> long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.</p><p>As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Bloodthirsty]{Bloodthirsty}:</span> Bugbears are very brutal killers and like to inflict pain. </li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Brute Strength:</span> Bugbears are naturally strong, and start with a d6 in @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Strength} instead of a d4.

Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression. It's also an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.</p><h3>A Hidden People</h3><p>Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether their presence is known.</p><p>Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler.</p><p>In creating a changeling adventurer, consider the character's relationships with people around them. Does the character conceal their true changeling nature? Do they embrace it? Do they have connections to other changelings or are they alone and in search of companions?</p><h3>Masks and Personas</h3><p>In their true form, changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shapeone created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history-is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona with a history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p><p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on dutywill adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Change Appearance]{Change Appearance}:</span> Changelings can alter physical appearance at will as per the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Disguise]{disguise}</em> power except it cannot affect clothing or gear.

Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.</p><p>Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm belowwhich was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten. </p><h3>Dwarves of the Mror Holds</h3><p>The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions-strange symbiotic items that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.</p><p>Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element ofyour character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.</p><p>Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.</p><h3>Dwarves of the Five Nations</h3><p>Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes-and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.</p><p>When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?</p><h3>Dwarves and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Mark of Warding} </em>appears on dwarves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}, which had its origins as one of the clans of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}. @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Kundarak} dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.</p><p>In addition to providing all manner of security, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Dwarven Resilience]{Dwarven Resilience}:</span> Dwarves are hardy and resistant to toxins.

This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow-assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} and settled the island nation of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.</p><p>Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf, Drow]{drow}, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.</p><p>As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship wit.h the past: Do you value the traditions ofyour ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?</p><h3>Elves of the Five Nations</h3><p>Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there.</p><p>As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions ofyour ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.</p><p>Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?</p><h3>Elves and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadow}</em> first appeared among the elves of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan} line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.</p><p>Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadow} </em>appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Bladesan espionage agency in the service of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}'s Sibling Kings.</p><h3>Aereni and Tairnadal</h3><p>For thousands of years, the island nation of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.</p><p>Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars-against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did.

Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends.

Today they linger on @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.</p><p>Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.</p><h3>A Drow Adventurer</h3><p>When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?</p><p>How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust.

As refugees of the Sundering and subsequent expansion of Riedra, the eneko have now been forced into one of the last free corners of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}. Also known as \"mongrel ogres\", eneko are a true breeding race in their own right with a long and rich cultural heritage.</p><h3>Free People</h3><p>The home of the eneko, Syrkarn, is a sanctuary of freedom, diversity and humility built out of yuan-ti ruins by refugees fleeing the monolithic culture and military of Riedra. Eneko and humans equally make up the vast majority of the loose nation's inhabitants, and the philosophy of the eneko is difficult to separate from the region they call home. Eneko from Syrkarn value community, personal freedom, and honest labour above all.</p><p>Many eneko live in nomadic tribes, and those that make a home in Sykrarn's cities still must contend with the harsh storms of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona} and the dangerous ruins left by ancient civilizations. This trains into all eneko a profound respect for the land and its challenges, and hones their almost supernatural resilience to the elements. Eneko travelers are among the most difficult for Riedra's Thousand Eyes to track.</p><h3>Mixed Bloodlines</h3><p>Eneko originated from the pairings of the ogres of Borunan and the nomadic half-giants that wander the continent. According to half-giant legend, their people are the progeny of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}'s native humans and giant explorers from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}. Grandiose eneko may claim that the blood of the ancient human sorcerer kings and the mightiest titans of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} flows through their veins. While many Riedrans deride the eneko, labelling them \"mongrels\", eneko themselves view the diversity of their heritage as one of their greatest strengths.</p><h3>Dark Magic</h3><p>The arcane power displayed by their legendary forebearers leads many eneko to the study of magic. The cult of Karrak the Final Guardian, a deity sometimes called an aspect of the Keeper, is said to have its origins in the giants of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}.

Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.</p><h3>Gnomes of Zilargo</h3><p>To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some ofwhich persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals-of which there are many-often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.</p><p>Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.</p><p>When you're making a Zil gnome character, consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.</p><p>Additionally, consider your relationship to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}: why you have left, and what ties do you still have to it? Your scheme could provide a good reason for you to leave. Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories ofyour adventures back to the Korranberg Chronicle. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}. Ifyou are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent-gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.</p><p><strong>Zil Names. </strong>Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.</p><h3>Gnomes of the Five Nations</h3><p>As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.</p><p>As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.</p><h3>Gnomes and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{Mark of Scribing}</em> appears among the gnomes of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}.

They love bureaucracy and intrigue as much as the gnomes of their homeland, but they have carefully cultivated a reputation for impartiality and secrecy, since their services rely on trust.</p><p>Today, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis} provides avenues of communication across Khorvaire. Translation, mediation, interpreting, and legal advocacy all fall within @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis's} broad purview, and they maintain the network of message stations that allow cross-continent communication</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Diminutive:</span> Gnomes average only about three feet tall, reducing their @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} (and therefore @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Making Characters]{Toughness}) by 1.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Gnome Magic]{Gnome Magic}: </span>Gnomes are inherently magical creatures.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Amongst the most areas of Khorvaire goblins are at best second class citizens that are often nothing more than scavengers. Among the <em>dar</em> or goblinoid races, goblins are known as the <em>golin'dar</em>, the \"quick people\", known as crafters, skilled labor, and excellent scouts. Not knowing any better, when humans came to Khorvaire they named the goblinoid people after the most prolific breeders, goblins.</p><h3>City Goblins</h3><p>Goblins dwell in most o f the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} during the Last War.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Agile:</span> Goblins are naturally quick and agile.

New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term \"half-elf,\" instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning \"children of Khorvaire.\"</p><p>The elves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.</p><p>In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?</p><h3>Khorvar</h3><p>The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.</p><p>Many Khoravar espouse the idea of \"the bridge between,\" the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.</p><p>Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.</p><p>As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory.

Half-giants refer to their groups as families, rather than tribes or clans, although few members of a family are actually blood-related.

But in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p><p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p><ul><li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes.

The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use. </p><h3>Talenta Halflings</h3><p>The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.</p><p>As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.</p><p>Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halfiings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur—like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs ofyour home remains strong.</p><p>Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration. </p><h3>Halflings of the Five Nations</h3><p>Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.</p><p>Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sham, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Stormreach]{Stormreach}. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point ofcontact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron.</p><h3>Halflings and Dragonmarks</h3><p>Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Mark of Healing}</em> in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda's} <em> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Mark of Hospitality}</em>. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} received their first marks—centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}  joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.</p><p>With its powers related to food and shelter, the <em> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Mark of Hospitality}</em> was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the <em> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Mark of Healing}</em> has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Athletic: </span>Halflings are nimble beings.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Among the <em>dar</em> or goblin people, hobgoblins are known as <em>ghaal'dar</em> or \"mighty people\". Hobgoblins are the most organized and intelligent of the goblinoid species, often holding the positions of power and organization.</p><h3>The Ghaal'dar</h3><p>The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun. The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.</p><p>As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters?

Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.</p><h3>Bound to Spirits</h3><p>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature ofyour linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers.</p><h3>Hunted by Nightmares</h3><p>The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dominate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.</p><p>Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Dual Mind: </span>Because of the guidance from the quori spirit with which they are bonded, kalashtar begin play with a d6 @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Spirit} instead of a d4.

The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p><p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p><ul><li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call ofKalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.</li><li>The Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li><li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li></ul><h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3><p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p><p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs.

While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.</p><h3>Living Steel and Stone</h3><p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.</p><p>Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids.

For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.</p><p>The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose—such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land—and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.</p><p>The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity.</p><p>The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Built for War:</span> Warforged were designed, built, and trained as tools of war.

The historical development of languages and cultures also explains the scripts used to write various languages. For example, the Orc language is written using the Goblin script, because the orcs of Khorvaire learned writing from the goblins. Common is the language of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and the language of trade in Khorvaire, known by most of its people. Goblin was the trade language of the goblin empire of Dhakaan and survives as the primary language in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, and the Shadow Marches. Goblin displaced the Orc language; the people of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches} typically speak Goblin, and Orc is an exotic language.

They are reliable and predictable, and their powers are constructive. They create; they heal; they protect.</p><p>But there is another kind of dragonmark: marks that are unpredictable and dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Someone with such a mark can kill with a touch or control minds with a glance. Aberrant marks often apopear when people from different dragonmarked families produce a child, and for this reason such unions are absolutely forbidden by the Twelve. But aberrant dragonmarks can appear on members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two aberrant dragonmarks are exactly alike—even if they grant the same power, they may appear and manifest in different ways. If two aberrant marks might grant <a class=\"entity-link content-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers\" data-id=\"QBm57hlOSWLmnk0I\"><em>bolt</em></a>, one mark may be formed from scar tissue while another is traced on the skin in lines of cold fire.</p><p>While aberrant dragonmarks can be disturbing, on the surface an aberrant mark seems no more dangerous or threatening than the powers of a sorcerer. So, what makes them significant? First of all, aberrant marks always have flaws. These may not actively hurt a character, but they are always a burden in some way—a burden that could drive a weak-willed person to madness.</p><p>It takes time for a character to learn to control their mark, and in time people may be hurt. If an aberrant mark grants <a class=\"entity-link content-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-powers\" data-id=\"QBm57hlOSWLmnk0I\"><em>bolt</em></a>, the person who carries it might have severely burned or even killed a loved one. Imagine having the power to cast charm person but being unable to control it and having people you care about suddenly becoming slavishly devoted to you. All of these factors have led to the general superstition that people with aberrant dragonmarks are dangerous, that their marks drive them crazy or turn them into sociopaths. These are things that can happen; people have a right to be afraid. But it is possible for an aberrant to learn to control their mark and to endure the flaw.</p><h3>War of the Mark</h3><p>An aberrant dragonmark is a gift of mystical power, though it can be a painful and distressing curse to bear, and its powers might even be difficult or, in some cases, impossible to control. Even an ability that duplicates a spell as simple as fire bolt can be devastating to the individual, and a person who possesses such a mark could have killed friends or even destroyed city blocks in a fiery blaze before mastering this power. This has led the common people to fear those who carry aberrant marks, paranoid that all of them could be murderers, mad, or both. The progenitor dragon Khyber is said to be the source of all things monstrous and evil, and those who carry aberrant dragonmarks in adolescence are called Children of Khyber.</p><p>Aberrant marks are feared for another reason, too. Long ago, aberrant marks were more common and some held great powers. Aberrant leader Halas Tarkanan could devastate cities with powerful earthquakes. The Lady of the Plague wielded disease and commanded hordes of vermin. The dragonmarked houses united in an inquisition called the War of the Mark. Some say this was a persecution of innocents, but most feared the aberrants and stood by as the houses hunted them down. Following the War of the Mark, aberrant dragonmarks were few in number and relatively weak. But since the Mourning, aberrant marks have been appearing in greater numbers.</p><h3>Trappings</h3><p>All trappings of the powers from aberrant dragonmarks should reflect the general destructive and often painful qualities of the dragonmark.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.Q7sPGiMfmcjMzVx8"}},"_id":"JWI5QBNBgGIEbizG"},{"sort":1150000,"name":"Arcane

CONCOCTIONS:</span> Alchemists can't use the Selective Power Modifier.</li><li><p><span class=\"list-heading\">ALCHEMIST'S BAG:</span> Concoctions are stored in an alchemist's bag, as are the ingredients, glassware, and other scientific equipment she needs to create them.

Their potions aren't like those listed in the Treasure chapter—those last for years, require investment of funds, and are created with the Crafting rules.</p><p>Instead, alchemists imbue their potions, grenades, and oils with the powers they've learned. Narratively, their concoctions are created “off-camera” some time prior to their use. In game terms, they're “cast” as the player needs them—pulling various vials or containers from their alchemist's bag or bandoleer and activating them as needed.</p><p></p><aside class=\"sidebar\"><h3>Ginving Concoctions to Others</h3><p>An alchemist can “administer” her concoction to nearby allies just like casting any other power. If she wants to give someone a concoction to carry or use later, she states the concoction's power and invests it with any number of her current Power Points.</p><p>Gifted concoction are created with a specific aspect—boost Trait (Strength), for example, or sloth (but not speed). The alchemist has no choice in this—she can't give someone boost Trait without naming the Trait affected, even if her power doesn't normally have the Aspect Limitation.</p><p>Gifted concoctions last until used or 48 hours pass, whichever comes first. Once their Power Points are used, the alchemist recovers them normally.</p><p>The recipient rolls the maker's Science skill to activate the concoction, just as if the alchemist were administering or using it herself.</p><p class=\"example\"><strong>Example:</strong> Red and Gabe are with a caravan when it's hit by bandits. The raiders ride off with several captives and Red wants to give pursuit. Gabe, an alchemist, must stay behind to heal the injured, so he gives his friend oil of protection and invests one Power Point in it. Protection's normal Range is Smarts and its cost is 2, but since Gabe made it an oil (Range of Touch), it counts as the Range Limitation and reduces the cost to 1. A few hours later finds Red in hot pursuit of the bandits. She applies the magical oil to her armor and rolls Gabe's Alchemy skill. She gets a raise and gains +2 Toughness! Gabe saves her skin—literally—even though he's many miles away!</p></aside><h3>Trappings</h3><p>When an alchemist “casts” a power, the player must describe how it's delivered.</p><p>Powers with a Range of Self or Touch are usually a consumable potion, edible, pill, salve, or oil. Fatigue from Critical Failure affects the recipient if someone other than the alchemist.</p><p>Powers with greater Range use misters, bellows, or grenades, with a maximum Range of 12” (24 yards). The alchemist “throws” the grenade or fires the bellows or mister with his Alchemy skill rather than Athletics or Shooting (but treats other projectiles normally). Critical Failure affects the caster normally—the grenade or mister shatters in his hand, showering him with noxious fumes that cause Fatigue.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.Q7sPGiMfmcjMzVx8"}},"_id":"wXYbdsmh4JyBYJsu"},{"sort":1400000,"name":"Arcane

This might mean defeating powerful enemies, saving a true love, or overcoming some great mystery or problem.</p><p>The victory should be an achievement over and above the usual. A vampire hunter in <cite>Rippers</cite> shouldn’t get Conviction every time he kills a vampire, for example, but he might when he wipes out an entire coven or slays a powerful master vamp­ire. A super hero might gain Conviction when she saves her true love from a death trap or the clutches of a powerful villain. She wouldn’t earn it just because her boyfriend is in a dangerous encounter.</p><p><strong>Tragedy:</strong> Some of the most interesting heroes of fiction, film, and legend spend as much time battling their personal demons as they do fighting their foes. Eventually these same issues give them strength as they work through their grief or overcome obstacles to rise once more against the challenges they face.</p><p>When a character experiences a significant personal loss or destructive event, and the DM feels it’s appropriate, he gains Conviction. The death of a loved one or close friend (including a party member he was close to), losing an important job, giving in to harmful character flaws and vices, being removed from a case or quest, or getting framed for a crime are all classic examples of heroic tragedy.</p><p>These might happen in the course of the game, but players should also proactively suggest their own ideas to the Dungeon Master. Consider your hero’s backstory and occasionally look for ways to do what your favorite authors do to their characters—torture them! Think about what’s important to them and threaten it or take it away. Most of the time this should be done as a quick narrative tale or a scene with a little interaction and roleplaying so as not to distract from the main campaign or the other players’ time, but occasionally it might inspire a side-trek or adventure to regain—or avenge!—whatever was lost.</p><p>Note that earning Conviction for harmful behavior is motivation for players in a game to occasionally spotlight their character’s dark side. It is not an endorsement or rationalization of poor conduct in the real world.</p><h2 class=\"example\">Example: Red's Rage</h2><p>Emily is Red, a fighter in a fantasy campaign. She has “anger management issues” but didn’t take the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.Mean]{Mean} Hindrance because she’s had her problem under control for a year or so. But it’s a fun part of her backstory and Emily loves roleplaying constantly managing her character’s temper.</p><p>Unfortunately, Red and her constant ally Gabe failed in their last adventure. Emily decides this is a good time for Red to go on a rampage. She narrates a story about going into town and terrorizing everyone in sight with her surly attitude. During the course of a “bad day,” she breaks a window, turns over an apple cart, and even insults a friar’s mule!</p><p>The DM loves Emily’s story and awards her a point of Conviction. In the game, Red is barred from the local tavern, has to pay for all the damage she caused, and is refused help by the friar (the town’s only healer!) until she performs some act of penance (a new quest!)</p><p>More importantly, Emily told a story about her heroine’s tragic flaw—and has a point of Conviction to carry her through the next chapter of her quest.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Creative Combat","type":"text","_id":"CaRakOoWuzrXz04O","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\"><h1 class=\"wide\">Creative Combat</h1><p>Creative Combat is an optional rule a Dungeon Master may allow to give @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Test]{Tests} more varied results.

After all, we've given the stat blocks for several evil deities, and there's no restriction on characters worshipping them. However, there is a price to pay for villainy.</p><p>Heroes who perform heroic deeds earn bonuses through their elevated Glory—villains get very little reward for being evil. Of course, to earn Glory a hero has to take great risks and maintain a certain code of conduct, whereas a villain doesn't have that restriction.</p><p>As such, villains are easy to play, but heroes get all the rewards for being \"forced\" to act in a certain manner.</p></aside><p>Everything living eventually dies. However, while a mortal's flesh may rot off the bone, his name can live forever through his deeds. Skalds and bards sing tales of heroes who perished long ago, keeping the memory of these figures as alive today as it was when they walked Eberron.</p><p>Glory has nothing to do with social standing, wealth, or who one calls friend—it is a mark of a character's reputation as a hero. A king may be well known across the lands, but that does not make him a hero, nor does it entitle him to become the focus of ballads or epic poems. Only through heroic deeds can a character aspire to enter the history books and oral myths of Eberron.</p><p>Your hero's Glory starts at zero, but can be affected by his or her actions during the course of the game. The higher your hero's Glory, the more renowned he is across Eberron and the more benefits he gains.</p><p>Just as Glory define the acts of a hero, so does Infamy define the acts of a villian. Infamy is Glory that has gone into the \"negative\".</p><h3>Glory vs. Rank</h3><p>A hero's Rank is a measure of his experience, although it does incorporate a degree of glory. Rank is a by-product of earning experience in adventures and quests, which aren't always linked to heroic deeds. Sure, the hero may rescue a princess, but the rescue might be fairly mundane and quickly forgotten. Only deeds which attract attention count toward Glory.</p><h2>Gaining Glory</h2><p>Glory is measured in Glory Points. Characters can rise to become famous heroes or slip into mediocrity or do deeds so heinous that they are remembered in Infamy.</p><p>Glory should not be dolled out like candy. It should be earned through heroic endeavors, good roleplaying, and investing heavily in character, not expected just because the hero is a player character.</p><h2>Variable Glorious Deeds</h2><p>After each adventure, and only when the heroes return to civilization, one of the party may begin telling the tale of their epic battles and heroic deeds. The character makes a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} roll, modified as below.</p><p>The DM is always free to add positive modifiers for truly heroic actions or based on the character's weaknesses and how he overcame them. Always try to think of how the heroes' true exploits (as opposed to any extra bits they invent) sound as a tale told by skalds. This is important, as it is the listeners on Khorvaire who are effectively granting them Glory.</p><p>Ideally, an extra +1 or +2 should be the maximum. For instance, slaying a dread liche is certainly worthy of praise, but that is already covered in the table. However, lopping off his head with a Called Shot as the killing blow is worth a small modifier, as it's the sort of detail found in epic poems.</p><p>Likewise, a Novice party with a d6 as their highest combat skill (including @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skills}) who slay a bunch of orc warriors in melee without any assistance should be rewarded with a greater chance of fame.</p><p>The DM may also opt to add penalties to reflect weaker opponents (such as unarmed or unarmored orcs) or favorable character circumstances (every hero had a dozen alchemical <em>blast</em> devices on hand).</p><table><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Glorious Deeds</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Reason</th><th class=\"sub-heading centered\" style=\"width:20%\">Modifer</th></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Stroryteller</span></th></tr><tr><td>Is a bard/skald/storyteller</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td>Has negative Glory</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–2</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Highest Character Rank</span></th></tr><tr><td>Seasoned</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–1</td></tr><tr><td>Veteran</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–2</td></tr><tr><td>Heroic</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–4</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–6</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">highest Number of Foes</span></th></tr><tr><td>You outnumbered them</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–1</td></tr><tr><td>They outnumbered you more than 2 to 1</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td>They outnumbered you more than 4 to 1</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td></tr><tr><td>They outnumbered you more than 10 to 1</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+4</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Highest Foe's Toughness</span></th></tr><tr><td>4 or less</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–1</td></tr><tr><td>5 to 6</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+0</td></tr><tr><td>7 to 10</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td>11 to 15</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td></tr><tr><td>16 to 20</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+4</td></tr><tr><td>21 or more</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+6</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Wild Cards</span></th></tr><tr><td>Per Wild Card</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td>Per named Wild Card</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td></tr><tr><td>Per Wild Card killed in a single blow</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+4</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">magic</span></th></tr><tr><td>A foe had an AB with 5 or less powers</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td>A foe had an AB with 6 to 10 powers</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td></tr><tr><td>A foe had an AB with 11+ powers</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+4</td></tr><tr><td>The had power magical items</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td>The foe had a relic</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Arcane Background:</strong> Where multiple foes with an @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Arcane Backgrounds]{Arcane Backgrounds} were defeated, only the highest bonus applies.</p><p><strong>Character Rank: </strong>The higher the heroes' @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.saneNpHYSTivNRYE]{Rank}, the more dangerous foes they must overcome before anyone is interested in their tales. After all, when you've already slain a giant, who cares if you killed an orc chieftain?</p><p><strong>Foes' Toughness:</strong> Once you start talking about fighting a giant, listeners tend to forget or lose interest in the orcs you defeated in an earlier encounter. As such, only the highest @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Making Characters]{Toughness} of defeated foes counts.</p><p><strong>Named Wild Card:</strong> No one really cares much if a hero slays a generic orc chieftain, but the slaying of Nargal the Terrible is a notable deed. Not every @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} should, or indeed can, be named. Sometimes a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} orc chief is just a nameless foe.</p><p><strong>Number of Foes:</strong> As with foes' @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Making Characters]{Toughness}, once you begin telling how the party slew a dozen orcs in one encounter, talk of beating five or six tends to become dull to the average listener. As such, only record the greatest number of foes slain in a single encounter. Defeating three orcs in one room and eight in another equates to only eight orcs.</p><p>The party size includes any allies on the heroes' side—a party with 20 members must defeat a lot of foes at once to get noticed. Even if the heroes forget to mention their helpers, any survivors will be telling their own stories across Rassilon.</p><p><strong>Single Blow:</strong> A @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Wild Card} killed in a single blow must have been unwounded when the killing blow was delivered. Chopping the head off a dread liche with 3 wounds is not exactly heroic.</p><p>Likewise, the foe must have been aware of the party and capable of retaliation—slaughtering sleeping dragons or <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Entangle]{entangled}</em> giants doesn't make a good story, though the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Entangle]{entangle}</em> spell might be worth a small bonus.</p><p><strong>Storyteller:</strong> Although anyone can tell a story, skalds are trained in using the right words and adjusting the rhythm to keep an audience enthralled. They can turn even a mundane adventure into an epic struggle.</p><h3>Glory Awards</h3><p>With a success, every hero involved in the action gains 1d6 Glory. A raise increases this to 2d6. Failure earns no bonus or penalty. A critical failure, however, causes the loss of 1d6 Glory, perhaps because the listeners disbelieved the storyteller or doubt the prowess of the party to achieve what they claim. Roll the dice for each individual member of the party earning or losing Glory.</p><p>Glory awards can be altered by the GM, but this should be done only for truly notable actions. Modifiers normally apply solely to individual members of the party, not every member.</p><p>For instance, the hero who delivered the Called Shot to the head, killing the dread liche, should earn a +1 or +2 bonus for his notable deed. This actively encourages use of special maneuvers and imaginative combat, as opposed to the standard \"attack–damage\" routine.</p><p>Of course, if one hero played little part in the action, perhaps because he was Incapacitated early on or spent the whole time cowering in fear, he should receive less Glory than those who were in the thick of the action. Just because he's a player character and was present does not entitle him to the same reward as those who risked their lives and took part in the bulk of the action.</p><p>Such a hero may roll his dice with a –3 penalty, for example, possibly earning a small penalty overall with an unlucky roll because of his inaction.</p><h2>Fixed Glory Awards</h2><p>Fixed Glory awards cover lesser deeds not played out (such as events during long periods of downtime), killing smaller number of foes during an adventure (they do slowly add up over time), or rewards for which there are many witnesses (battles or rescues). These are in addition to any Glory gained above.</p><p>DM's are encouraged to devise their own modifiers for things like concluding peace treaties or founding new mercantile routes that benefit a large population. Although notable deeds, the rewards for these types of endeavor should not be overly high—few people will remember who signed a peace treaty, but you can bet they'll recall a hero who risked his life to venture into the heavily guarded camp of the enemy commander and kill him in an epic duel.</p><h2>Achieve Rank</h2><p>Even without performing major heroic deeds, a hero can become famous through his collective lesser deeds. Such rewards are typical of the examples above, especially the slaying of lesser foes.</p><p>These are wrapped into a single +5 Glory bonus gained when a hero achieves a new Rank. It is possible, though rare, for a hero to reach Legendary status with no additional Glory—he has performed many deeds, but none stand out as truly heroic.</p><h2>Mass Battles</h2><p>War is a terrible thing and something sane men avoid, but it can also grow and break reputations.</p><p>Use the table below whenever the characters are involved in a fight using the Mass Battle rules. Whereas skirmishes are commonplace, true mass battles remain rare events. Hence, all Glory modifiers are fixed.</p><table class=\"centered\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\"><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Glory for Mass Battles</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Reason</th><th class=\"sub-heading centered\" style=\"width:20%\">Modifier</th></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Size</span></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Smallest army had hundreds of troops</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Smallest army had thousands of troops</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+3</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Smallest army had more than 10,000 troops</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+5</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Enemy</span></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Hated rival of your nation</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+/–1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Undead Army</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+/–2</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Victory</span></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Enemy had less tokens or was equal</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">For each token the enemy had above yours</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+2</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Defeat</span></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Enemy had more tokens or was equal</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">For each token less your enemy had</td><td style=\"width:20%\">–3</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Personal heroics</span></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">Two raises on Heroes in Mass Battles rolls</td><td style=\"width:20%\">+1</td></tr><tr><th class=\"bar-heading\" colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"no-class\">Commander</span></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">You commanded the army</td><td style=\"width:20%\">x2</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Character Roll:</strong> Scoring a double raise is more than just a die result. It represents a major event within a battle, such as slaying an enemy commander or slaughtering so many foes a battalion breaks.</p><p>However, the modifier only applies if the number of enemy tokens was less than or equal to your army's tokens at the time (slaying an enemy commander when you have a +3 bonus is nowhere near as heroic as when you have a –3 penalty.</p><p><strong>Commander: </strong>A hero who commands an army gains greater Glory than his troops for victory, but also suffers more ignominy if he loses the field. Take the final Glory modifier and double it to see what the hero earned.</p><p><strong>Defeat:</strong> Defeat is never easy to live with, but the ignominy is far worse if you outnumbered your foe. For each token you outnumbered your enemy at the start of a battle you suffer a –3 penalty.</p><p><strong>Enemy Forces: </strong>Certain races are more despised than others. To qualify for the bonus, the specific enemy must account for more than 75% of the enemy army's troop strength.</p><p>Add the modifier if the heroes won, and subtract it if they lost (a defeat by a hated foe usually means the enemy will grow more confident and thus pose a greater danger in the future).</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>Huge armies are rare in Khorvaire now the Last War is over, and thus while any battle earns Glory, the more participants there are the greater the tale told.</p><p><strong>Victory: </strong>Everybody loves a winner. The greater the size of the enemy army, the more reward is earned. For each token your enemy's army was larger than yours when battle commenced, the hero earns a +2 Glory bonus.</p><h2>Rescue</h2><p>Even if the heroes' tale of how they killed a hundred orcs doesn't earn them any immediate Glory, having prisoners recount the tale of their rescue quickly causes word to spread.</p><p>Important NPCs must be famous, powerful, and named. A merchant, wizard, priest, minor noble, or similar is worth +1 Glory. Saving a count or a skilled spellcaster is worth +3. Rescuing a prince, king, or truly powerful spellcaster gains the hero +5 Glory.</p><p>For groups of lesser NPCs, rescuing ten or so is worth +1 Glory, a few tens +2, and a hundred or more +3. Saving a lone villager from an orc tribe is brave, but not enough to be retold by skalds.</p><p>Rescue doesn't have to mean entering a prison and breaking captives out. Liberating a village beset by frostreavers, for instance, counts as a rescue. If the rescue involves a Mass Battle rather than tabletop action, the party is deserving of the Mass Battle rewards as well.</p><h2>Glory Benefits</h2><p>Being a hero has its perks. When a hero reaches a multiple of 20 Glory he must immediately pick one benefit from the list below, meeting any requirements. Some heroes may opt to acquire Followers or become leaders of men and build a personal army. Others might use their fame to gain valuable connections or become better combatants, while others may prefer to rely on their reputation to ensure a friendly welcome in civilized lands.</p><p>Unless otherwise stated, benefits can be taken multiple times—the number in parentheses after the name indicates the maximum number of times the benefit may be taken. Fill in the appropriate section of the character sheet.</p><p>Should Glory drop below a multiple of 20, any benefits above the character's current Glory level are temporarily lost (unless otherwise stated) until Glory is regained. Dropping below 20 and then rising above it again does not grant the opportunity to take a new benefit—it simply allows the “lost” one to be used again.</p><table class=\"centered\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\"><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"3\">Glory Edges</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Edge</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Requirements</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Summary</th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Combat Prowess]{Combat Prowess}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">20+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Gain a Combat Edge.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Connection]{Connection}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">40+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Hero gains friend(s) among an organzition aligned with him.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Favored]{Favored}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">60+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Hero gains an extra @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.NUjlHH5PBpH1dlzH#bennies]{Benny}.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Followers (Glory)]{Followers}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">40+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Hero gains @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Followers]{Followers}, as per the Edge.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Heroic Aura]{Heroic Aura}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">40+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">The Hero's @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Making Characters]{Toughness} increases by 1.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Heroic Status]{Heroic Status}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">20+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 bonus to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Reaction Table]{Reaction Table} results, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Intimidation]{Intimidation}, and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Networking]{Networking}.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Immortalized in Song]{Immortalized in Song}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Heroic Status taken 4 times</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Number of Followers the Hero has doubles.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Leader of Men]{Leader of Men}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">40+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Hero can take a Leadership Edge.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:left\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Sidekick]{Sidekick}</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">80+ Glory</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Leader gains the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Sidekick]{Sidekick} Edge.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class=\"example\">Example: Barak the Fair</h2><p><em>Dave's character, Barak the Fair, has the Heroic Status benefit, which he took he reached 20 Glory.

Such items typically take twice as long to create if commissioned.</p><h2>Special Materials</h2><p>Weapons and armor are often created with special materials found on Eberron. These materials improve combat effectiveness or have effects against creatures with resistances and weaknesses. Special materials don’t stack, only the best quality applies in any situation.</p><p>Anything made from the following materials is considered masterwork, adding 300 gp to its base cost before other cost modifiers (see Masterwork).</p><ul><li><p><span class=\"list-heading\"><strong>Adamantine: </strong></span>Mined from rocks that fell from the heavens, adamantine adds +1 AP to any melee weapon or ranged weapon ammunition made of its metal. This stacks with the bonus from masterwork items. Adamantine weapons cost an additional 3,000 gp. Ammunition costs an addition 60 gp per missile.</p><p>Adamantine armor is harder to pierce than that made from other materials. It ignores up to 2 points of AP. Armor made from this material costs an extra 3,000 gp per point of armor bonus.</p></li><li><span class=\"list-heading\"><strong>Alchemical Silver:</strong></span> A complex process involving metallurgy and alchemy can bond silver to a steel weapon. This allows them to affect creatures with a Weakness to silver, such as lycanthropes. They cost ten times normal price.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\"><strong>Darkwood:</strong></span> This rare wood is much lighter than normal. Items carved from it weigh half as much as typical equivalents and cost an additional 10 gp per pound of the original weight to the price of a masterwork version of the item. Darkwood items increase Hardness (or Toughness if the hull of a vehicle) by 2.</li><li><p><span class=\"list-heading\"><strong>Dragonhide:</strong></span> Armorers can fashion their products with the hides of dragons when such wonders become available. The number of armor pieces that can be crafted from a single dragon is equal to half its size (rounded up). The hide can be used to craft light, medium, or heavy armor and counts as masterwork, granting the same bonus as other armors of the same type ( +2 to +4).</p><p>Additionally, wearing dragonhide armor grants the wearer an additional +4 armor against the element tied to the dragon's breath weapon. For example, blue dragonhide gives resistance to electricity. This benefit stacks with the Energy Resistance enchantment. Dragonhide costs an additional 2500 gp beyond the cost of the normal armor it's mimicking. So a Dragonhide Breastplate costs 3000 gp.</p></li><li><span class=\"list-heading\"><strong>Cold Iron:</strong></span> Mined from the deepest depths of Khyber, cold iron is the weakness of certain demons and fey creatures. Weapons forged with cold iron increase Hardness by 2 and cost twice as much as normal.</li><li><p><span class=\"list-heading\"><strong>Mithral:</strong></span> A rare metal on Eberron, mithral is forged like steel but weighs much less. Mithral reduces the Minimum Strength of weapons, armor, and shields one die type (this stacks with the bonus from masterwork) and the weight by half. Weapons and shields made primarily of mithral (DM's call) cost 100 times normal, while armor costs 10 times normal <em>per piece.</em></p><p>Mithral weapons count as silver for purposes of creatures with a silver Weakness.</p></li></ul></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"Vehicles","type":"text","_id":"0gEO9rIDDS0BSHcg","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\"><h1 class=\"wide\">Vehicles</h1><p>Below are a number of sample vehicles (conveyances) for land, air, and water on Eberron.</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Size:</span> The Size and Scale of the vehicle relative to a human (see <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Size and Scale]{Scale}</strong> and the <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Size Table]{Size Table}</strong>.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Handling:</span> The vehicle’s responsiveness and maneuverability is added or subtracted from all its operator’s maneuvering rolls (@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Boating]{Boating}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Piloting]{Piloting}, or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Riding]{Riding}). This typically ranges from −4 for particularly slow or sluggish vehicles to +4 for those that can turn on a dime.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Top Speed:</span> Top Speed is expressed in miles per hour (MPH) for easy comparison to the real world. To convert miles per hour to Pace, multiply MPH by 1.5.</li><li><p><span class=\"list-heading\">Toughness:</span> The vehicle’s base durability, including Armor in parentheses. Use these as guides when creating your own.<br />Vehicles can normally take three Wounds before they’re <strong>Wrecked</strong> (see below), but Large Vehicles can take one additional Wound, Huge vehicles two, and Gargantuan three.</p></li><li><p><span class=\"list-heading\">Crew:</span> The first score is the number of crew required to operate the ship’s sails, rigging, and so on. Having less than this number subtracts 2 from the crew’s Boating rolls, and having less than half the required number subtracts 4. Sailors must have a minimum Boating skill of d6 to count as crew. <br />The required crew does not count gunners. Each gun fired or reloaded in a round requires two gunners. Note that most vessels can get by with manning only half the guns at any one time (since they’re firing only on one side). </p></li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Passengers:</span> The number after the plus is the number of passengers the vessel can easily accommodate, including places to eat, sleep, and linger. Up to twice this number can travel for short distances (about a day or less).</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Cost:</span> The typical price of the vehicle in Eberron. This will vary widely depending on the type of vehicle, the environment, its condition, and other market factors.</li><li><p><span class=\"list-heading\">Cargo Space:</span> This is the number of cargo spaces the ship has. Cargoes are bought by “spaces” rather than having to keep track of every individual bunch of bananas or carton of grapes. <br />The exact dimensions of cargo spaces are deliberately vague to keep bookkeeping to a minimum. If it becomes important to know, each cargo space is roughly six feet square. <br />A cargo space may be converted to hold two guns instead (one on either side of the vessel).</p></li></ul><h2>Vehicle Notes</h2><p><strong>Heavy Armor:</strong> Only weapons marked as Heavy Weapons can hurt this vehicle, regard­less of the damage roll. This keeps a lucky bow shot from destroying a longship, for example. Vehicles with Heavy Armor halve damage they take from colliding with other obstacles (including vehicles) that don’t have Heavy Armor. This is not to be confused with the heavy category of personal armor.</p><p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Vehicles with weapons note their location for narrative play or when using miniatures on the tabletop. Here are the most common:</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Fixed:</span> The vehicle’s weapon fires only in the listed direction (typically front or rear in a 45° arc).</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Swivel Mount:</span> The weapon is mounted on a post or platform that can turn and fire in a 180° arc in the listed direction.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Turret:</span> The weapon is in a turret and can freely fire in a 360° arc.</li></ul><div><img src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/general/jewelry.webp\" /></div><aside class=\"sidebar\"><h1>Vehicle damage</h1><p>A vehicle can take three Wounds before it’s wrecked.

Unless an attacker states otherwise, hits are always directed at the victim’s torso.</p><p>Worn armor doesn't stack with other worn armor, but does stack with natural armor (such as scaly skin) at its full value.</p><h2>Armor Piercing (AP)</h2><p>The weapon or projectile ignores this many points of Armor value. A weapon with an AP value of 4, for instance, ignores 4 points of Armor. Excess AP is lost.</p><h2>Brace</h2><p>The weapon counts as having +1 Reach when determining who has the greater Reach when set against a charge (see Mounted Combat).</p><h2>Damage</h2><p>Damage is listed in terms of dice. Projectile weapons have fixed damage (such as 2d6). Melee weapons have damage based on the wielder’s Strength die plus another die, as listed under individual weapon entries. A dagger, for instance, inflicts Str+d4 damage.</p><h2>Heavy weapon (HW)</h2><p>The weapon can affect vehicles or other devices with <strong>Heavy Armor</strong> (see @UUID[Compendium.swpf-core-rules.swpf-rules.swpfcore02gear00.JournalEntryPage.02vehicles000000]{Vehicles}). This is not to be confused with categories of personal armor— such as heavy armor or shields.</p><h2>Minimum Strength</h2><p>Certain items have a “Minimum Strength” required to use without penalty. Note that some items list a d4 since it is possible to have a Strength lower than d4.</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Armor/Shields/Worn Gear:</span> Each die type differ­ence between the character’s Strength and the item’s Minimum Strength inflicts a −1 penalty to Pace (minimum of 1), Agility, and Agility-related skill rolls. This is cumulative for those weak but determined adventurers who wear or use multiple items too heavy for their build.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Melee/Thrown Weapons:</span> A thrown or melee weapon’s damage die is limited by the user’s Strength die. If a scrawny kid (Strength d4) picks up a long sword (Str+d8), he rolls d4+d4 damage instead of d4+d8. Also, if the user’s Strength is less than its Minimum Strength, he doesn’t benefit from any of the weapon’s positive abilities such as Reach or Parry bonuses. He still retains any penalties, however.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Weapons:</span> The user suffers a −1 attack penalty for each die step difference between his Strength and the weapon’s minimum.</li></ul><h2>Parry</h2><p>The weapon adds the bonus to the character’s Parry score. If a character wields a weapon in each hand, penalties to Parry stack but bonuses do not (unless she has the Ambidextrous Edge). This also applies to carrying two shields at once (use the best Parry bonus).</p><h2>Range</h2><p>This lists the weapon’s Short, Medium, and Long Range. Extreme Range is up to 4×its Long Range. See <strong>@UUID[Compendium.swpf-core-rules.swpf-rules.swpfcore03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03combat00000000]{Ranged Attacks}</strong> for @Compendium[swpf-core-rules.swpf-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} or @Compendium[swpf-core-rules.swpf-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} (throwing) modifiers and more details.</p><p>Ranges are listed in inches so you can use a ruler to move, shoot, and fight on the tabletop with miniatures. If you’re not using miniatures, each inch equals two yards (6 feet).</p><p>Weapon ranges are “effective” ranges for the table-top.</p><h2>Reach</h2><p>Weapons with “Reach” allow their user to make Fighting attacks at the listed range. A Reach of 1, for example, allows a character to strike a target 1″ (2 yards) distant. Weapons without a Reach value can only strike targets at arm’s length (adjacent).</p><p>Reach can be very important when fighting from horseback and <em>against</em> mounted foes (see @UUID[Compendium.swpf-core-rules.swpf-rules.swpfcore03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03combat00000000]{Mounted Combat}).</p><h2>Reload</h2><p>A character can ready and fire a bow every action— see @UUID[Compendium.swpf-core-rules.swpf-rules.swpfcore02gear00.JournalEntryPage.02gear0000000000]{Reloading}. Heavy crossbows and black powder muskets are slower to reload. The number after the Reload keyword is how many actions of reloading it takes before a weapon can be fired again.</p><h2>Two Hands</h2><p>A two-handed weapon can be used with one hand at a −4 penalty. The hero counts full Strength for damage but loses all other advantages such as Reach or Parry bonuses.</p><p>Two-handed weapons are normally required to make use of the Sweep Edge.</p><h2>Weapon Size</h2><p>Weapons wielded by some creatures may be larger or smaller than those listed here A Giant's battleaxe, for example, is larger than a human's, while a kobold's longsword is smaller. The GM can increase or decrease the Minimum Strength and weight as logically needed, but other statistics (Range, damage, etc.) remain as listed.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Armor","type":"text","_id":"lqXUYuw4NjqgE9Wp","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\"><h1 class=\"wide\">Armor</h1><table><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"5\">Armor</th></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><p>Armor is written in parentheses next to a character’s Toughness, like this: 11 (2).

They serve as troops under your hero’s command in war, loyal retainers serving strongholds, or fellow fighters in glorious rebellions against oppression.</p><p><strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Use these rules to help keep track of the party’s followers and give them a little extra personality to play off of as well.</p><p><strong>The Basics:</strong> Players create, control, and track their own followers and nonplayer character allies.</p><h2>Using Allies</h2><p>Keeping up with allies in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is simple. Just download the Ally Sheet from our website and fill in the blanks.</p><p>Allied @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Wild Cards and Extras]{Extras} are divided up among all the players to control. This is a very important part of <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> because our adventures often feature allied bands of skilled hirelings, fellow grunts, or loyal retainers, and the game is designed to handle them quickly and easily. It’s also designed for the players to control them — not the Dungeon Master.</p><p>It doesn’t matter whether the <em>characters</em> control the allies, only that the <em>players</em> do. This keeps everyone involved in the action even if his hero is out of the fight, and makes running large combats much easier and more fun for everyone. Of course the DM can always take charge of Extras when the need arises, but with good roleplayers this is rarely necessary.</p><h3>Allied Personalities</h3><p>You can add a little flavor to your allies by rolling on the <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-tables.Allied Personalities]{Allied Personalities}</strong> table. Jot down the keyword on the Ally Sheet so you and your Dungeon Master have a little insight into each particular ally’s character.</p><p>Consider these general impressions with no particular game effect. They help both the player and DM decide just how an ally might react in a given situation.</p><p>If a party of adventurers tasks a retainer with keeping watch, it's helpful to know which ones are Observant and which ones are Lazy!</p><table><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"4\">Allied Personalties</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading left\">d20</th><th class=\"sub-heading\">Personality</th><th class=\"sub-heading\">d20</th><th class=\"sub-heading\">Personality</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td class=\"centered\">Treacherous</td><td class=\"centered\">11</td><td class=\"centered\">Crude</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td class=\"centered\">Cruel</td><td class=\"centered\">12</td><td class=\"centered\">Agile</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td class=\"centered\">Old</td><td class=\"centered\">13</td><td class=\"centered\">Observant</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td class=\"centered\">Happy</td><td class=\"centered\">14</td><td class=\"centered\">Clueless</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td class=\"centered\">Experience</td><td class=\"centered\">15</td><td class=\"centered\">Mysterious</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td class=\"centered\">Gung-Ho</td><td class=\"centered\">16</td><td class=\"centered\">Creative</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td class=\"centered\">Lazy</td><td class=\"centered\">17</td><td class=\"centered\">Artistic</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td class=\"centered\">Sneaky</td><td class=\"centered\">18</td><td class=\"centered\">Fearless</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td class=\"centered\">Bright</td><td class=\"centered\">19</td><td class=\"centered\">Cowardly</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td class=\"centered\">Young</td><td class=\"centered\">20</td><td class=\"centered\">Heroic</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Allies &amp; Advancement</h3><p>Allies can improve their abilities as well.

This doesn't permanently give her a power, but allows her to use any spell or miracle from her Available Powers list and of her Rank or lower for one entire encounter.</p><p>The character may also temporarily change the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Trappings]{Trapping} of a power she already has for one encounter—turning a fireball into an ice blast, for example.</p><p>The spell is cast at a −2 penalty, but is otherwise treated just like one of the caster's regular powers. This can be particularly useful if the mage or priest must prepare to face a threat with a particular weakness.</p><p>Finally, Research can also be used to reveal deep information about a particular subject. No Trait roll is required. The DM decides just how much the investigator can learn in a week given the topic, the location, and resources at hand.</p><h2>Rest</h2><p>Those who have suffered grievous @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Damage Effects]{Wounds} might need to do so during Downtime to recover their health.</p><p>Use the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Natural Healing]{natural healing} rules during the week.

A character might train @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} by sparring with a swordmaster, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion} by public speaking, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Arcana]{Arcana} by studying forbidden tomes, @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Strength} or @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Vigor} with vigorous exercise, and so on.</p><p>The character must possess at least d4 in any skill chosen for training.

Here are some guidelines.</p><p>Assume each player will average one success per turn. Use that as a guideline if you want the task to be \"fair,\" and set the number of rounds from three to five as appropriate. A party of five given three rounds to save a galleon in a storm, for example, needs to accumulate 15 Task Tokens in three rounds. Increase or decrease the number of tokens to make it more or less challenging.</p><p>If the number of tokens achieved is a measure of success rather than a straight win/fail condition, such as rescuing victims from a fire or hauling up bags of gold from a collapsing mineshaft, simply set the possible number of tokens that may be gathered in the time allowed. Each token gathered represents a person saved, a bag recovered, etc. It’s up to you whether it’s possible to save them all (using the guide above) or not.</p><p>Let the party choose how many will attempt the task, especially if there’s something else going on at the same time. Deciding how many heroes will break into the jail to rescue a friend while the others fight off the corrupt city guard allows <em>them</em> to choose their tactics.</p><h2>Performing the Task</h2><p>Characters are dealt @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#action-cards-(initiative)]{Action Cards} as usual during a Dramatic Task. Those attempting the task make relevant skill checks and get a Task Token for each success and raise. Failure means no progress and a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} reduces progress by one (if any has been made).</p><p>The skills that can be used to accumulate tokens depends on the situation. They might be defined, such as @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} to disable a trap, or they might be open — a heroic paladin might use @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} to carry people from a burning building while a mage uses <em>telekinesis</em> (@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Spellcasting]{Spellcasting}) to do the same.</p><h3>Multiple Skills</h3><p>The DM can break tasks down into steps if she likes, each of which might require different skills. If disabling a difficult trap in the dark, for example, the heroes might first have to get two tokens to get the feel for their surroundings using @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, then three more tokens using Thievery to cut all three trip wires in the correct order.</p><p>Requiring multiple skills throughout the task makes it more difficult since raises from one type of skill check don’t carry over to the other. In the trap example above, for example, the first step requires two Notice successes. Additional successes <em>don’t</em> carry over to the Thievery rolls needed afterward.</p><h3>Complications</h3><p>If a character’s Action Card is a Club, something has gone wrong. Attempts to resolve the task (or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support} it!) are made at an additional −2.</p><p>Worse, if a roll is failed during a Complication, the Dramatic Task fails — the trap springs, the lock jams, a victim cannot be saved, and so on. The character may choose <em>not</em> to attempt a roll on a turn he has a Complication — it just costs him precious time.</p><p><strong>Support:</strong> Characters assisting (via Support)also suffer the Complication penalty, and an additional −2 if <em>their</em> Action Card is a Club! @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} on their part just subtracts from the lead’s roll as usual, however, it doesn’t cause the entire task to fail.</p><h3>Death Traps</h3><p>Think carefully before designing Dramatic Tasks that might wipe out the entire party if failed. The threat of catastrophe should be very real but you don’t want a couple of bad die rolls to end the entire game.</p><p>Instead of total disaster, maybe the party has a moment to dive clear before the trap triggers. They don’t perish, but later awake in the care of a local healer or are captured and find themselves about to experience a new type of adventure.</p><h2 class=\"example\">Example: Dragon fire!</h2><p>An evil red dragon roams the countryside, burning farms and villages throughout the land. @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Seelah]{Seelah} the paladin and @Compendium[savage-eberron-bestiary.savage-eberron-bestiary.Harsk]{Harsk} the ranger watch in horror as the dragon breathes fire down on their favorite tavern. The pair rush to aid the choking and gasping patrons attempting to flee the burning building.</p><p>The Dungeon Master decides rescuing the survivors is a three-round, Multi-Person Dramatic Task. There are 10 patrons. Each success saves one of them from the inferno.</p><p>On the first round, Seelah and Harsk roll @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} to run into the tavern and drag someone out. Both get a raise, so that's four citizens saved!</p><p>The next round, Harsk gets a Complication. The DM decides he becomes trapped in one of the back rooms and must make a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} roll at −2. If he fails, it takes him too long to escape and he won't be able to save any more patrons. Harsk draws his brother's trusty @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Axe, Battle]{battleaxe} and hacks his way free. He decides to go with it and narrates using his Fighting to hack open a hole in the wall for the survivors.

Failure causes the effects listed below:</p><ul><li><strong>Disabling:</strong> These poisons dull one of the victim’s attributes and linked skills (chosen at the time of creation) by creating hallucinations, inhibiting nerve function, causing euphoria, etc. The affected attribute is reduced a die type (two with a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.hCxcCUCRxHOWcNGS]{Critical Failure} on the @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Vigor} roll) for 30 minutes.</li><li><strong>Knockout:</strong> The victim is knocked out (@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Incapacitation]{Incapacitated} and unconscious) for 2d6 hours (twice that with a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure}).</li><li><strong>Lethal:</strong> The victim is @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.OPSttc2CAS2LC1ju.JournalEntryPage.37hOhcNkT98KKtAv]{Stunned}, takes a Wound (two with a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure}), and perishes in 2d6 rounds.</li><li><strong>Mild:</strong> The victim suffers @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}, or Exhaustion with a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure}.

If successful, the victim’s life is saved and the poison no longer has any ill effects — paralyzed victims can move and those rendered unconscious wake.</p><p>Each character may only attempt one Healing roll per incident to cure the poison, but another character with Healing may try as well.</p><h3>Delievery</h3><p>Poisons are delivered in several ways. In all cases, a being can’t be forced to resist the same type of poison more than once per round.</p><p><em>Contact poisons</em> must touch bare skin. They can also be applied to a weapon and remain effective for four hours.</p><p><em>Inhaled poisons</em> are released by breaking their container. They form a Medium Blast Template cloud and affect everyone within.</p><p><em>Ingested poisons</em> must be consumed. The target may make a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} roll to detect the poison’s smell or taste before consuming.</p><p><em>Injury poisons</em> must be applied to a piercing or cutting weapon, and are delivered when an attack isn’t Soaked and results in Shaken.</p><h3>Purchasing Poisons</h3><p>Whether poisons can be bought openly or not depends on the setting. In most fantasy worlds, mild poisons or those used to take care of vermin or other common nuisances are readily available. Those typically used for more sinister purposes must be obtained via the black market or from those who set themselves off from the rest of society.</p><h3>Crafting Poisons</h3><p>Characters can make their own poisons for half the cost listed below. Doing so uses the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Healing]{Healing}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Science]{Science}, or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Survival]{Survival} skill and d6 hours of preparation per batch. A @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} during this process results in the poisoner poisoning himself!</p><p><strong>Strength</strong>: The crafter can make the potion stronger (resisted at Vigor –2) by increasing the time to 2d6 hours and paying the full cost listed below.</p><h3>Antidotes &amp; Treatment</h3><p>Antidotes for poisons use the same crafting rules. An antidote only works against the specific type of poison for which it is created, and gives the user a Vigor roll minus half the strength of the poison to recover completely from its effects (including removing Hindrances for Lotus Dust).</p><p>As long as a chracter has a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-gear.Healer's Kit]{Healer's Kit} they may make a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Healing]{Healing} roll minus the strength of the poison (if any modifier is listed) to stop its effects. If successful, the victim’s life is saved and the poison no longer has any ill effects—paralyzed victims can move and those rendered unconscious wake.</p><p>Each character may only attempt one Healing roll per incident to cure the poison, but another character with Healing may try as well.</p><h2>Random Traps</h2><p>Draw two cards from the Action Deck whenever you need a trap on the fly. These tell you everything you need to know about its concealment, complexity, type, and lethality. Very occasionally you'll need to draw a third card, but the rules below tell you when to do this.</p><p>The DM should add suitable flavor to these draws based on the trap type. For instance, a \"blade trap\" could be a scything blade slicing from the wall at knee height or a spear which thrusts out from a concealed hole. A Spade result on the trap might indicate multiple blades, hence the high Fighting die and increased damage. A portcullis of the Club suit might be heavily corroded or made of wood, whereas a Spade indicates extremely tough and well-made bars.</p><h3>First Card</h3><p>The first card determines how difficult the trap is to detect and disarm. This is shown on the <strong>Trap Difficulty Table</strong> below as modifiers to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery] rolls.</p><p>Note that <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Glyph]{glyph}</em> traps cannot be disarmed by mundane means (and so ignore the suit), but they can be <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Dispel]{dispelled} </em>and negated. Use the suit entry of the second card on the Trap Type table below to determine the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} die for this purpose.</p><p><strong>Detecting: </strong>Detecting a trap requires a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice} roll. Unless a character has @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Danger Sense], searching for traps requires an action. A @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#movement]{running} hero rolls at –2. A single roll is made in a round, regardless of how far the hero moves. With success, he detects the first trap adjacent to him. A @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} locates a second trap within line of sight, if such exists. The hero may halt his movement if he spots a trap (advisable if it's right in front of him).</p><p><strong>Disarming: </strong>Disarming a detected trap requires a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery] roll and takes a complete round (no other actions possible, including movement). On a critical failure, the trap activates and automatically affects the unfortunate hero.</p><table><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"4\">Trap Difficulty</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Value</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Detect</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Suit</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Disarm</th></tr><tr><td>Joker</td><td>+2</td><td>Joker</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>2–4</td><td>+1</td><td>Club</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>5–10</td><td>0</td><td>Diamond</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Jack–Queen</td><td>–1</td><td>Heart</td><td>–1</td></tr><tr><td>King–Ace</td><td>–2</td><td>Spade</td><td>–2</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Second Card</h3><p>The second card determines the exact type of trap encountered.

Ranged attacks use the standard range brackets for the type of missile launched. Whatever projectile is launched, range is calculated as normal. The distance listed for pits is their depth. <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-powers.Glyph]{Glyph} </em>traps affect an area or operate at range as per the spell description and the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} die.</p><p><strong>Duration: </strong>Traps are generally one-shot devices. Once activated, they must be reset in order to work again.

A second Joker indicates the trap is faulty and does not work.</p><p>** Portcullis traps either have a single gate (usually to block the way the party has come and so force them forward) or drop two gates (one ahead and one behind the intruders to trap them in a small area). Due to the confines of most corridors or doorways, a maximum of two people can combine their Strength in a Cooperative roll to lift a portcullis.</p><p>*** Alternately, a pit may drop the victims into a lower level of the “dungeon” rather than a small hole, thus separating the party. Another version could be a chute, which drops the victim into a cell or monster’s lair on a lower level but without inflicting any damage.</p><p>**** One spell of the DM's choice.</p><h2 class=\"example\">Example: Random Trap Encountered</h2><p>Aelric Olafsunu is exploring a ruined temple when the DM decides to place a trap in his path. The DM draws two cards. He gets a 3 of Hearts and the King of Diamonds.</p><p>The 3H tells the DM that there is a +1 bonus to the Notice roll to spot the trap (indicated by the 3) and a –1 modifier to disarm it (indicated by the Hearts). The trap is fairly complex, but not very well disguised. Unfortunately, Aelric isn't looking out for traps and walks straight onto it. The DM decides it is a pressure plate mechanism.</p><p>As this occurs outside of combat, Aelric rolls his Notice to avoid Surprise. He adds +1 from the first card's value, and scores 8. The DM tells Aelric he hears an audible click as his foot hits the floor and deals him an action card. Aelric declares he wants to move clear of the square he is on. Before he can do this, however, the trap tries to interrupt him.</p><p>The trap has a fixed d10 @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Agility} and rolls a 9. Aelric rolls his @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Agility} and gets a lousy 5. Aelric has been hit by a falling lump of masonry (as determined by the King value of the second card). He suffers 2d8 damage (determined by the Diamonds).</p><p>Note that although the trap scored a raise over Aelric's @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Agility} total, this was not an attack roll and so it does not deal +1d6 damage.</p><p>Aelric suffers 11 damage, enough to cause him a wound. He vows to be more careful as he descends deeper into the temple.</p><h2>Sleep</h2><p>Most people need a minimum of six hours’ sleep out of every 24. A character who goes without must make a @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO.JournalEntryPage.VWEUOsd2rvNu6ch9]{Vigor} roll every 24 hours thereafter or suffer @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue}. Tea or similar stimulants add +1 to the roll.</p><h2>Thirst</h2><p>An average-sized human requires two quarts of water a day. This requirement is doubled in very dry conditions (such as the desert) or areas of great heat and high humidity (the jungle) as the character perspires constantly and begins to dehydrate.</p><p>If enough water isn’t available, the hero begins to suffer from dehydration.

The duration is listed in the haunt. This continues until the haunt is destroyed.</p><p><strong>Destroying a Haunt:</strong> To completely destroy a haunt, its source must be destroyed.

When used in this way, Persuasion isn’t a single exchange but several hours of networking, hobnobbing, carousing, drinks, gifts, bribes, or entertaining. This might represent time roaming a marketplace, a series of meetings with important people, or an evening of food and drink.</p><p>Success grants most of what the character wants, though it may take a while, cost some money, or require a favor in return.

A @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} means he’s cut off from that particular group for a while (up to the DM but typically about a week).</p><p><strong>Money Talks:</strong> You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar, the saying goes.

A simple failure means the evening ends with <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps and Bruises}</strong>. A Critical Failure bears more serious consequences. The DM might break the action down to an actual encounter (which might be an ambush!).

Instead, the DM describes the scene, and then the players agree on a general plan and what their characters will do to resolve the situation.</p><p>Once all the players state their intent, they pick the skill that best represents their actions during the encounter and roll.

If the heroes greatly outnumber their opposition, pursue much slower prey, have prior experience with the obstacles in their path, or special equipment to deal with hazards, the roll might be made at +1 to +4.</p><p>Very difficult encounters, such as powerful foes (relative to the party), faster prey, or extreme conditions inflict a −1 to −4 penalty.</p><h3>Turn Order &amp; Critical Actions</h3><p>Players can go in whatever order they want in a Quick Encounter. This might be important if some of their actions are dependent on someone else's. In a heist, for example, the group might depend on a smooth-talker to gather information about the target's security before the thief attempts to break in. Similarly, a battle commander might need to send a scout across enemy lines before sending in a team to sabotage the enemy's war engine.</p><p>Resolve these kinds of actions in the order that makes sense, and allow those who come after to change their own plans as the situation changes.</p><p>If a critical task is failed, the DM must decide if it stops the encounter or simply complicates it (perhaps inflicting a penalty to everyone else's roll). In the heist example above, for example, maybe the charmer gets the information but tips off someone who adds extra sentries, inflicting a −2 penalty to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth} or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Thievery]{Thievery} rolls. Likewise, the scout might find the war engine's location but the enemy moves the device shortly thereafter, adding the need for additional reconnaissance for the team of saboteurs.</p><p>These kinds of complications might also mean resolving the encounter in multiple stages instead of one roll as the heroes must react to the changing circumstances (see <strong>Staged Encounters,</strong> below).</p><h3>Staged Encounters</h3><p>Quick Encounters are typically a single die roll followed by some narration between the DM and the players. But some encounters might need additional rounds to better reflect the results or any new information or events that come to light.</p><p>If the heist to break into a wizard's tower and steal a powerful occult artifact goes badly, for example, the next stage might become a crisis when the tower suddenly bursts into supernatural flames. That might then lead to a combat encounter as an artifact in the wizard's study breaks and releases an angry djinn!</p><p>The beauty of staged encounters is their ability to handle complex problems when the constraints of time or larger narrative require a speedy resolution.</p><h2>Encounter Results</h2><p>Once each player has determined her skill and any modifiers, she rolls the dice and works with the Dungeon Master to narrate the details based on the total, the situation, and the other players' actions.</p><h3>Dangerous Encounters</h3><p>If a character fails his roll in a dangerous situation he takes a @UUID[JournalEntry.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#damage-effects]{Wound} (or d4 Wounds with a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure}). If he's the driver of a vehicle, it takes a Wound (or d4 with a Critical Failure). Wounds may be @UUID[Compendium.sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1hmxcp48L0ZxhzeE.JournalEntryPage.5QA7pQEuHMHqFdoe#soak-rolls]{Soaked} as usual.</p><p>Success means the hero emerges with only <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bumps and Bruises]{Bumps and Bruises}</strong>, and a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Raises]{raise} means he escapes unscathed.</p><h3>Nonlethal Encounters</h3><p>If the encounter isn't physically dangerous, failure means the hero doesn't contribute to the party's overall success somehow. @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Critical Failures]{Critical Failure} means she suffers social stigma, loses or breaks a piece of vital equipment, is positively identified, or gets the wrong information. This likely means moving on to a second stage of the encounter as she deals with the fallout of her errors.</p><h3>Success &amp; Failure</h3><p>In general, narration and individual actions determine the success or failure of an encounter. If the smooth-talker can't learn the habits of the sentries, for example, and the DM decides this fact shuts down the operation rather than complicating it, the encounter fails. In other words, let the story tell the tale.</p><p>In a more dynamic situation such as combat, assume the group \"wins\" if there are at least as many total successes (one for each success and raise) as there are player characters. They get the information, drive off their foes, complete the mission, or avert (or escape) the crisis. @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support} rolls <em>don't</em> count as successes.</p><p>If there are fewer successes than player characters, they fail. Specifics are up to the Dungeon Master, but this might mean the party has to fall back or retreat from their foes, their prey escapes, they don't get the object or information they sought, they survive the crisis but can't save most of the bystanders, and so on.</p><p>If they can try again, the DM should \"reset\" the encounter with the new narrative so the group has to come up with a new plan. And of course, their foes are likely on to them now!</p><h3>Ammo &amp; Power Points</h3><p>Use the rules for <strong>Ammo &amp; Power Points</strong> under <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Mass Battles]{Mass Battles}</strong> for combat encounters if desired. Otherwise the player and DM can just decide what resources were consumed in the encounter.</p><h2 class=\"example\">Example: Night on the prowl</h2><p>Our heroes must break into a nobleman's library, steal an ancient book, and stop an evil conspiracy that threatens all of Eberron.</p><p>The group decides to play out the break-in as a Quick Encounter.

The bard supports her with a diversionary recital in the town square.</p><p>The DM decides the rogue's Thievery roll is at −2 to get into the library. The bard gets a success with his @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Performance]{Performance} to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Support]{Support}. He adds +1 to his friend's roll.</p><p>The rogue manages a single success, but since there are two player characters and the rules say they need at least as many successes as there are characters, they fail.</p><p>The DM says three of the nobleman's guards are alerted by the pair's actions. The heroes can continue if they want, but the encounter is now more difficult (−2). The DM also says it's now a Dangerous Encounter as the guards are armed and nervous.</p><p>With the fate of Eberron at stake, the party agrees to press on.
