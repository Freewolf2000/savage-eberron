Do you want to try a wily @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Wizard]{wizard}, a burly @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Barbarian]{barbarian}, a tricksy @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Rogue]{rogue}, or some original idea you’ve come up with yourself? The <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> rules allow you to create most anything.</p><p>For the world of <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>, take a close look at the Class Edges subsection in Setting Edges @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Setting Edges]{here}. These special abilities form the foundation of the typical player character types found in Eberron. Keep these in mind as you follow the rest of these steps so you can build toward those if you want to play a traditional Eberron-style hero.</p><h2>Species</h2><p>This core rule book comes with nineteen recommended species to use when creating player characters. See species for more info @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Ancestry]{here}.</p><h2>Hindrances</h2><p>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances} are flaws, drawbacks, or dark secrets drawn from a character’s backstory. They provide up to four additional “Hindrance points” you can use to enhance your hero during character creation.</p><p>Taking Hindrances not only helps you define and roleplay your hero, but also allows you to increase his @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{attribute or skill} points, take @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}, or have additional gold to buy better adventuring gear.</p><p>A Major @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Hindrances]{Hindrance} is worth 2 Hindrance points, and a Minor is worth 1. A hero could thus take two Major Hindrances, four Minor, or any combination that adds up to 4 character points. (You can take <em>more</em> Hindrances if you want but the maximum benefit is 4 points!)</p><p><strong>For 2 Hindrance points you can:</strong></p><ul class=\"bullet\"><li>Raise an attribute one die type, or</li><li>Choose an Edge</li></ul><p><strong>For 1 Hindrance point you can:</strong></p><ul class=\"bullet\"><li>Gain another skill point, or</li><li>Start play with an additional 600 gold pieces.</li></ul><h2>Traits</h2><p>Characters are defined by attributes and skills, collectively called “Traits.” Attributes and skills are ranked by die types, typically from d4 to d12, with d6 being the average for adult humans. Higher is better!</p><p>Attributes typically govern how fast your skills can increase, and are used for passive effects such as resisting spells or recovering from injuries.</p><h3>Attributes</h3><p>Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, and Vigor (discussed in more detail in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits}).</p><p>You then have 5 character points to increase your attributes. Raising a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point.</p><p><strong>Attribute Limit:</strong> No attribute may be raised above a d12 unless an ancestral ability or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edge} says otherwise. Each increase beyond a d12 adds a +1 modifier. Increasing a d12 Strength two steps or “die types,” for example, gives your hero a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} score of d12+2.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Skills are learned abilities such as firing weapons, hand-to-hand combat, scientific knowledge, professional aptitudes, and so on.</p><p>Skills in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> are very broad to keep the action simple and straightforward. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} skill, for example, covers all types of bows and crossbows. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} skill covers thrown weapons, as well as grappling, swimming, and climbing. Detailed customization comes in the form of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}.</p><p><strong>Core Skills:</strong> Five skills are marked with a red star in the list for skills in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits}: <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}</strong>, and <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}</strong>. These are “innate” abilities most adult adventurers have. Unless an ancestral ability, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edge}, or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Hindrances]{Hindrance} says otherwise, your character starts with a d4 in each of these five core skills.</p><p><strong>Buying Skills:</strong> After core skills are assigned, you have 12 additional character points to raise core skills or buy and raise new skills as you see fit.</p><p>Each die type costs 1 point (starting at d4) as long as the skill is equal to or less than the attribute it’s linked to (listed beside the skill in parentheses, in the list starting in the Skills subsection in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits}). If you exceed the linked attribute, the cost becomes 2 points per die type.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Your character starts with Common and knows additional languages equal to half her @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Smarts} die type. Typical choices are listed with each ancestry. See Languages in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits} for more information.</p><p><strong>Skill Limit:</strong> Skills may not be increased above d12 during character creation unless the character’s ancestry starts with the skill at d6. If the skill starts with a d6, increase her maximum to d12+1. Elves in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Ancestry]{Races} start with a d6 in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, for example, which means their Notice skill may be increased to d12+1.</p><h3>Derived Statistics</h3><p>Your character sheet contains a few other statistics you need to fill in, described below.</p><p><strong>Pace</strong> is how fast your character moves in tactical situations like combat. Standard Pace is 6, which means six tabletop inches per game round. Each inch is two yards (6 feet) in the real world. <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Movement]{Movement}</strong> is explained in detail in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Combat]{Combat}.</p><p><strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry}</strong> is equal to 2 plus half your character’s @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} die type (a total of 2 if a character doesn’t have Fighting), plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. This is the Target Number (TN) to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>For Fighting skills higher than d12, such as d12+1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded down. For instance, Fighting d12+1 grants a Parry of 8, while Fighting d12+2 results in a Parry of 9.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> A hero’s default @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} is 0 unless altered by ancestral abilities, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}, or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances}. It cannot be less than −1 or more than +3.</p><p><strong>Toughness</strong> is your hero’s damage thres­hold. Damage rolls that equal or exceed this number @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Applying Damage]{cause harm} (explained later in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Rules]{Rules}).</p><p>Toughness is 2 plus half your hero’s @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Vigor}, plus @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Armor]{Armor} (use the armor worn on his torso. Vigor over a d12 is calculated just like @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry}, above.</p><h2>Edges</h2><p>Attributes and skills are a character’s basic statistics, but what really makes individuals different are their @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}.</p><p>In <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>, every character starts with a Class Edge for free. The character must qualify for the Edge as usual. (If a player doesn’t want to take a Class Edge, she may take a free Background or Professional Edge she qualifies for instead.)</p><p>Characters get additional Edges by taking @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances}, from racial abilities (such as Humans’ Adaptability), or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Advancement]{Advances} once play begins.</p><p>A comprehensive list of Edges for use in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is available @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{here}.</p><h2>Gear</h2><p>Player characters have 300 gold pieces (or “gp”) to purchase any of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Personal Weapons]{weapons}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Armor]{armor}, and adventuring gear presented in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Gear]{the Gear Chapter}.</p><p>This might represent everything the character owns or it may represent only “adventuring” gear, with the hero’s more mundane belongings stored at a home or elsewhere.</p><h2>Background</h2><img class=\"float-right\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/swpf-core-rules/assets/art/p18_Crafting_Spear_Maker.webp')\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/general/p18_Crafting_Spear_Maker.webp\" /><p>Finish your new hero by filling in any additional history or background you see fit. Ask yourself why she’s where she is and what her goals are. Where does she live? Does she have any close friends or family who might be relevant to the game? Why did she join the Pathfinders?</p><p>Or just start playing and fill in these details as they become important and you walk around in her shoes a bit.</p><p>You might also want to talk to the other players. Maybe your characters know each other right from the start. Or you might collectively decide to optimize your group a bit and ensure you’ve got a good assortment of skills and abilities. If so, make sure you’re playing what you want to play. There’s no point in being the party’s healer if that’s not a role you care to play.</p><h3>Deities and alignment</h3><p>The conflict between Good and Evil is a core theme of any <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> game. Typically, heroes fight for Good, but not always.</p><p>Alignments in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> indicate the general moral compass of a person, creature or organization. Where alignment is listed, it is a tool for the Dungeon Master to identify the broad outlook of that entity, and how it may interact with others, including the adventurers. When choosing an alignment for your character, you decide what ethical path he will follow, guided by the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges} and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances} you chose to define him. Unless your DM specifically agrees, you cannot choose Evil as your alignment.</p><p>Some character concepts require choosing a deity or “Domain” that governs powers and certain abilities. Likewise, the player’s choice of Hindrances can involve a Deity or a cause, such as @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Vow]{Vow} or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Code of Honor]{Code of Honor}. Deities have a listed alignment, either Good, Neutral, or Evil to indicate the general philosophy of the deity and her followers. Of course, adherents to a particular faith might not necessarily share the same outlook as the deity's alignment. Terrible deeds might be perpetrated in the name of a good or merciful god. You can find more information on domains and deities in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges} section.</p><div><h1 class=\"wide\">Character Creation Summary</h1><h3>Concept</h3><ul class=\"bullet\"><li>Start with a general idea of what you want to play.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Known as <em>guul'dar</em>, or \"strong people\", among the <em>dar</em> or goblin races. <em>Guul'dar</em> are born for battle and mayhem being fierce and aggressive. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despite being bossed around. In Darguun they living in tribes in the Marguul mountains, or in the <em>ghaal'dur </em>tribes ruling Darguun often serving as shock troops being ruled by the hobgoblins with superior numbers and intellect.</p><h3>The Marguul</h3><p>The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the <em>ghaal'dar</em> long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.</p><p>As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Bloodthirsty]{Bloodthirsty}:</span> Bugbears are very brutal killers and like to inflict pain. </li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Brute Strength:</span> Bugbears are naturally strong, and start with a d6 in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} instead of a d4.

Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression. It's also an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.</p><h3>A Hidden People</h3><p>Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether their presence is known.</p><p>Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler.</p><p>In creating a changeling adventurer, consider the character's relationships with people around them. Does the character conceal their true changeling nature? Do they embrace it? Do they have connections to other changelings or are they alone and in search of companions?</p><h3>Masks and Personas</h3><p>In their true form, changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shapeone created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history-is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona with a history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p><p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on dutywill adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Change Appearance]{Change Appearance}:</span> Changelings can alter physical appearance at will as per the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Disguise]{disguise}</em> power except it cannot affect clothing or gear.

Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.</p><p>Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm belowwhich was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten. </p><h3>Dwarves of the Mror Holds</h3><p>The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions-strange symbiotic items that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.</p><p>Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element ofyour character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.</p><p>Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.</p><h3>Dwarves of the Five Nations</h3><p>Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes-and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.</p><p>When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?</p><h3>Dwarves and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Mark of Warding} </em>appears on dwarves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}, which had its origins as one of the clans of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}. @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Kundarak} dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.</p><p>In addition to providing all manner of security, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Dwarven Resilience]{Dwarven Resilience}:</span> Dwarves are hardy and resistant to toxins.

This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow-assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} and settled the island nation of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.</p><p>Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf, Drow]{drow}, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.</p><p>As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship wit.h the past: Do you value the traditions ofyour ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?</p><h3>Elves of the Five Nations</h3><p>Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there.</p><p>As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions ofyour ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.</p><p>Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?</p><h3>Elves and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadow}</em> first appeared among the elves of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan} line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.</p><p>Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadow} </em>appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Bladesan espionage agency in the service of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}'s Sibling Kings.</p><h3>Aereni and Tairnadal</h3><p>For thousands of years, the island nation of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.</p><p>Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars-against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Agile or Intelligence:</span> Tairnadal Elves tend to be graceful and agile, while Aereni elves tend to be highly intelligent.

Today they linger on @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.</p><p>Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.</p><h3>A Drow Adventurer</h3><p>When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?</p><p>How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust.

Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.</p><h3>Gnomes of Zilargo</h3><p>To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some ofwhich persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals-of which there are many-often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.</p><p>Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.</p><p>When you're making a Zil gnome character, consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.</p><p>Additionally, consider your relationship to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}: why you have left, and what ties do you still have to it? Your scheme could provide a good reason for you to leave. Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories ofyour adventures back to the Korranberg Chronicle. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}. Ifyou are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent-gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.</p><p><strong>Zil Names. </strong>Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.</p><h3>Gnomes of the Five Nations</h3><p>As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.</p><p>As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Amongst the most areas of Khorvaire goblins are at best second class citizens that are often nothing more than scavengers. Among the <em>dar</em> or goblinoid races, goblins are known as the <em>golin'dar</em>, the \"quick people\", known as crafters, skilled labor, and excellent scouts. Not knowing any better, when humans came to Khorvaire they named the goblinoid people after the most prolific breeders, goblins.</p><h3>City Goblins</h3><p>Goblins dwell in most o f the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} during the Last War.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile?

New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term \"half-elf,\" instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning \"children of Khorvaire.\"</p><p>The elves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.</p><p>In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?</p><h3>Khorvar</h3><p>The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.</p><p>Many Khoravar espouse the idea of \"the bridge between,\" the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.</p><p>Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.</p><p>As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide inspiration for it.</p><h3>Half-evles and Dragonmarks</h3><p>Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{Mark of Detection} </em>is found in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} and the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{Mark of Storm} </em>in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}.

Some say the half-giants are degenerate offspring of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} titans, while others contend they have a mixed human ancestry.</p><p>What can be said is that the true-breeding half-giants are racially inclined toward psionic ability, and this racial trait binds them into tight-knit but individually isolated bands. Half-giants refer to their groups as families, rather than tribes or clans, although few members of a family are actually blood-related. In fact, many families adopt individuals of other races, particularly psionic ones such as elans, dromites, duergar, and maenads.</p><h3>Half-Giant Lands</h3><p>Half-giant families wander endlessly all over @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}, although they rarely stray into Riedran territory. There, they are often \"assimilated\"—a process beginning as slavery. What is remarkable is the degree to which they tend to coexist peaceably with denizens of all other regions. In Tashana, where families are known collectively as the Icebinders, half-giants have a long tradition of trade and cooperation with the shifter and human tribes. The Sandstrider families of Syrkarn keep more to themselves, with occasional but minimal conflict with the humans and eneko of the region.

The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use. </p><h3>Talenta Halflings</h3><p>The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.</p><p>As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.</p><p>Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halfiings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur—like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs ofyour home remains strong.</p><p>Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration. </p><h3>Halflings of the Five Nations</h3><p>Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.</p><p>Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sham, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Stormreach]{Stormreach}. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point ofcontact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron.</p><h3>Halflings and Dragonmarks</h3><p>Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Mark of Healing}</em> in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda's} <em> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Mark of Hospitality}</em>. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} received their first marks—centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}  joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.</p><p>With its powers related to food and shelter, the <em> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Mark of Hospitality}</em> was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the <em> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Mark of Healing}</em> has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Athletic: </span>Halflings are nimble beings.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Among the <em>dar</em> or goblin people, hobgoblins are known as <em>ghaal'dar</em> or \"mighty people\". Hobgoblins are the most organized and intelligent of the goblinoid species, often holding the positions of power and organization.</p><h3>The Ghaal'dar</h3><p>The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun. The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.</p><p>As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile?

Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.</p><h3>Bound to Spirits</h3><p>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature ofyour linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers.</p><h3>Hunted by Nightmares</h3><p>The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dominate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.</p><p>Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Dual Mind: </span>Because of the guidance from the quori spirit with which they are bonded, kalashtar begin play with a d6 @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Spirit} instead of a d4.

Such tieflings are touched by the fiendish forces bound beneath the Wastes, and the tribes consider them to be blessed. If you're playing such a tiefling, why have you left the Wastes? It could be that you were destined for some evil purpose-perhaps even serving as an avatar for an imprisoned Overlord-and you are fleeing that destiny.</p><p>Other tieflings are shaped not by fiendish powers, but by the influence of the fiend-tainted planes. Such tieflings might be born in manifest zones, where a plane exerts influence over a region. Planar tieflings are oddities, often seen as strange but not necessarily evil.</p><p>Finally, the Venomous Demesne—a city-state hidden on the far side of Droaam—is populated by tieflings. These tieflings descend from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}n mages who bargained with dark powers, with the Demesne's lords being powerful warlocks and wizards. The Venomous Demesne has had no significant contact with the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and few know it exists. Your character could be an envoy or exile from it, or simply an adventurer driven by a desire to see what lies beyond your homeland.</p><h3>Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h3><p>Tieflings rarely appear in the cities and towns of Khorvaire, with most dwelling at the fringes of civilization. Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.</p><p>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Darkvision]{Darkvision}:</span> Tieflings infernal heritage allows them to see into the darkness of Khyber.

While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.</p><h3>Living Steel and Stone</h3><p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.</p><p>Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids. </p><h3>Warforged Personality</h3><p>The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.</p><p>The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose—such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land—and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.</p><p>The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity.</p><p>The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Built for War:</span> Warforged were designed, built, and trained as tools of war.

The <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> rules allow you to create most anything.</p><p>For the world of <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>, take a close look at the Class Edges subsection in Setting Edges @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Setting Edges]{here}. These special abilities form the foundation of the typical player character types found in Eberron. Keep these in mind as you follow the rest of these steps so you can build toward those if you want to play a traditional Eberron-style hero.</p><h2>Species</h2><p>This core rule book comes with nineteen recommended species to use when creating player characters. See species for more info @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Ancestry]{here}.</p><h2>Hindrances</h2><p>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances} are flaws, drawbacks, or dark secrets drawn from a character’s backstory. They provide up to four additional “Hindrance points” you can use to enhance your hero during character creation.</p><p>Taking Hindrances not only helps you define and roleplay your hero, but also allows you to increase his @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{attribute or skill} points, take @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}, or have additional gold to buy better adventuring gear.</p><p>A Major @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Hindrances]{Hindrance} is worth 2 Hindrance points, and a Minor is worth 1. A hero could thus take two Major Hindrances, four Minor, or any combination that adds up to 4 character points. (You can take <em>more</em> Hindrances if you want but the maximum benefit is 4 points!)</p><p><strong>For 2 Hindrance points you can:</strong></p><ul class=\"bullet\"><li>Raise an attribute one die type, or</li><li>Choose an Edge</li></ul><p><strong>For 1 Hindrance point you can:</strong></p><ul class=\"bullet\"><li>Gain another skill point, or</li><li>Start play with an additional 600 gold pieces.</li></ul><h2>Traits</h2><p>Characters are defined by attributes and skills, collectively called “Traits.” Attributes and skills are ranked by die types, typically from d4 to d12, with d6 being the average for adult humans. Higher is better!</p><p>Attributes typically govern how fast your skills can increase, and are used for passive effects such as resisting spells or recovering from injuries.</p><h3>Attributes</h3><p>Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, and Vigor (discussed in more detail in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits}).</p><p>You then have 5 character points to increase your attributes. Raising a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point.</p><p><strong>Attribute Limit:</strong> No attribute may be raised above a d12 unless an ancestral ability or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edge} says otherwise. Each increase beyond a d12 adds a +1 modifier. Increasing a d12 Strength two steps or “die types,” for example, gives your hero a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} score of d12+2.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Skills are learned abilities such as firing weapons, hand-to-hand combat, scientific knowledge, professional aptitudes, and so on.</p><p>Skills in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> are very broad to keep the action simple and straightforward. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} skill, for example, covers all types of bows and crossbows. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} skill covers thrown weapons, as well as grappling, swimming, and climbing. Detailed customization comes in the form of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}.</p><p><strong>Core Skills:</strong> Five skills are marked with a red star in the list for skills in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits}: <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}</strong>, and <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}</strong>. These are “innate” abilities most adult adventurers have. Unless an ancestral ability, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edge}, or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Hindrances]{Hindrance} says otherwise, your character starts with a d4 in each of these five core skills.</p><p><strong>Buying Skills:</strong> After core skills are assigned, you have 12 additional character points to raise core skills or buy and raise new skills as you see fit.</p><p>Each die type costs 1 point (starting at d4) as long as the skill is equal to or less than the attribute it’s linked to (listed beside the skill in parentheses, in the list starting in the Skills subsection in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits}). If you exceed the linked attribute, the cost becomes 2 points per die type.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Your character starts with Common and knows additional languages equal to half her @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Smarts} die type. Typical choices are listed with each ancestry. See Languages in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits} for more information.</p><p><strong>Skill Limit:</strong> Skills may not be increased above d12 during character creation unless the character’s ancestry starts with the skill at d6. If the skill starts with a d6, increase her maximum to d12+1. Elves in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Ancestry]{Races} start with a d6 in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, for example, which means their Notice skill may be increased to d12+1.</p><h3>Derived Statistics</h3><p>Your character sheet contains a few other statistics you need to fill in, described below.</p><p><strong>Pace</strong> is how fast your character moves in tactical situations like combat. Standard Pace is 6, which means six tabletop inches per game round. Each inch is two yards (6 feet) in the real world. <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Movement]{Movement}</strong> is explained in detail in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Combat]{Combat}.</p><p><strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry}</strong> is equal to 2 plus half your character’s @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} die type (a total of 2 if a character doesn’t have Fighting), plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. This is the Target Number (TN) to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>For Fighting skills higher than d12, such as d12+1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded down. For instance, Fighting d12+1 grants a Parry of 8, while Fighting d12+2 results in a Parry of 9.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> A hero’s default @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} is 0 unless altered by ancestral abilities, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}, or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances}. It cannot be less than −1 or more than +3.</p><p><strong>Toughness</strong> is your hero’s damage thres­hold. Damage rolls that equal or exceed this number @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Applying Damage]{cause harm} (explained later in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Rules]{Rules}).</p><p>Toughness is 2 plus half your hero’s @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Vigor}, plus @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Armor]{Armor} (use the armor worn on his torso. Vigor over a d12 is calculated just like @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry}, above.</p><h2>Edges</h2><p>Attributes and skills are a character’s basic statistics, but what really makes individuals different are their @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}.</p><p>In <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>, every character starts with a Class Edge for free. The character must qualify for the Edge as usual.

Typically, heroes fight for Good, but not always.</p><p>Alignments in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> indicate the general moral compass of a person, creature or organization. Where alignment is listed, it is a tool for the Dungeon Master to identify the broad outlook of that entity, and how it may interact with others, including the adventurers. When choosing an alignment for your character, you decide what ethical path he will follow, guided by the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges} and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances} you chose to define him. Unless your DM specifically agrees, you cannot choose Evil as your alignment.</p><p>Some character concepts require choosing a deity or “Domain” that governs powers and certain abilities. Likewise, the player’s choice of Hindrances can involve a Deity or a cause, such as @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Vow]{Vow} or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Code of Honor]{Code of Honor}. Deities have a listed alignment, either Good, Neutral, or Evil to indicate the general philosophy of the deity and her followers. Of course, adherents to a particular faith might not necessarily share the same outlook as the deity's alignment. Terrible deeds might be perpetrated in the name of a good or merciful god. You can find more information on domains and deities in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges} section.</p><div><h1 class=\"wide\">Character Creation Summary</h1><h3>Concept</h3><ul class=\"bullet\"><li>Start with a general idea of what you want to play.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Known as <em>guul'dar</em>, or \"strong people\", among the <em>dar</em> or goblin races. <em>Guul'dar</em> are born for battle and mayhem being fierce and aggressive. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despite being bossed around. In Darguun they living in tribes in the Marguul mountains, or in the <em>ghaal'dur </em>tribes ruling Darguun often serving as shock troops being ruled by the hobgoblins with superior numbers and intellect.</p><h3>The Marguul</h3><p>The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the <em>ghaal'dar</em> long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.</p><p>As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Bloodthirsty]{Bloodthirsty}:</span> Bugbears are very brutal killers and like to inflict pain. </li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Brute Strength:</span> Bugbears are naturally strong, and start with a d6 in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} instead of a d4.

Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression. It's also an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.</p><h3>A Hidden People</h3><p>Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether their presence is known.</p><p>Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler.</p><p>In creating a changeling adventurer, consider the character's relationships with people around them. Does the character conceal their true changeling nature? Do they embrace it? Do they have connections to other changelings or are they alone and in search of companions?</p><h3>Masks and Personas</h3><p>In their true form, changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shapeone created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history-is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona with a history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p><p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on dutywill adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Change Appearance]{Change Appearance}:</span> Changelings can alter physical appearance at will as per the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Disguise]{disguise}</em> power except it cannot affect clothing or gear.

Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.</p><p>Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm belowwhich was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten. </p><h3>Dwarves of the Mror Holds</h3><p>The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions-strange symbiotic items that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.</p><p>Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element ofyour character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.</p><p>Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.</p><h3>Dwarves of the Five Nations</h3><p>Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes-and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.</p><p>When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?</p><h3>Dwarves and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Mark of Warding} </em>appears on dwarves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}, which had its origins as one of the clans of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}. @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Kundarak} dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.</p><p>In addition to providing all manner of security, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Dwarven Resilience]{Dwarven Resilience}:</span> Dwarves are hardy and resistant to toxins.

This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow-assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} and settled the island nation of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.</p><p>Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf, Drow]{drow}, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.</p><p>As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship wit.h the past: Do you value the traditions ofyour ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?</p><h3>Elves of the Five Nations</h3><p>Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there.</p><p>As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions ofyour ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.</p><p>Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?</p><h3>Elves and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadow}</em> first appeared among the elves of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan} line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.</p><p>Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadow} </em>appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Bladesan espionage agency in the service of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}'s Sibling Kings.</p><h3>Aereni and Tairnadal</h3><p>For thousands of years, the island nation of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.</p><p>Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars-against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Agile or Intelligence:</span> Tairnadal Elves tend to be graceful and agile, while Aereni elves tend to be highly intelligent.

Today they linger on @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.</p><p>Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.</p><h3>A Drow Adventurer</h3><p>When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?</p><p>How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust.

Also known as \"mongrel ogres\", eneko are a true breeding race in their own right with a long and rich cultural heritage.</p><h3>Free People</h3><p>The home of the eneko, Syrkarn, is a sanctuary of freedom, diversity and humility built out of yuan-ti ruins by refugees fleeing the monolithic culture and military of Riedra. Eneko and humans equally make up the vast majority of the loose nation's inhabitants, and the philosophy of the eneko is difficult to separate from the region they call home. Eneko from Syrkarn value community, personal freedom, and honest labour above all.</p><p>Many eneko live in nomadic tribes, and those that make a home in Sykrarn's cities still must contend with the harsh storms of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona} and the dangerous ruins left by ancient civilizations. This trains into all eneko a profound respect for the land and its challenges, and hones their almost supernatural resilience to the elements. Eneko travelers are among the most difficult for Riedra's Thousand Eyes to track.</p><h3>Mixed Bloodlines</h3><p>Eneko originated from the pairings of the ogres of Borunan and the nomadic half-giants that wander the continent.

While many Riedrans deride the eneko, labelling them \"mongrels\", eneko themselves view the diversity of their heritage as one of their greatest strengths.</p><h3>Dark Magic</h3><p>The arcane power displayed by their legendary forebearers leads many eneko to the study of magic.

Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.</p><h3>Gnomes of Zilargo</h3><p>To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some ofwhich persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals-of which there are many-often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.</p><p>Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.</p><p>When you're making a Zil gnome character, consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.</p><p>Additionally, consider your relationship to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}: why you have left, and what ties do you still have to it? Your scheme could provide a good reason for you to leave. Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories ofyour adventures back to the Korranberg Chronicle. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}. Ifyou are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent-gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.</p><p><strong>Zil Names. </strong>Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.</p><h3>Gnomes of the Five Nations</h3><p>As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.</p><p>As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.</p><h3>Gnomes and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{Mark of Scribing}</em> appears among the gnomes of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Amongst the most areas of Khorvaire goblins are at best second class citizens that are often nothing more than scavengers. Among the <em>dar</em> or goblinoid races, goblins are known as the <em>golin'dar</em>, the \"quick people\", known as crafters, skilled labor, and excellent scouts. Not knowing any better, when humans came to Khorvaire they named the goblinoid people after the most prolific breeders, goblins.</p><h3>City Goblins</h3><p>Goblins dwell in most o f the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} during the Last War.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile?

New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term \"half-elf,\" instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning \"children of Khorvaire.\"</p><p>The elves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.</p><p>In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?</p><h3>Khorvar</h3><p>The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.</p><p>Many Khoravar espouse the idea of \"the bridge between,\" the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.</p><p>Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.</p><p>As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide inspiration for it.</p><h3>Half-evles and Dragonmarks</h3><p>Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{Mark of Detection} </em>is found in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} and the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{Mark of Storm} </em>in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}.

Half-giants refer to their groups as families, rather than tribes or clans, although few members of a family are actually blood-related. In fact, many families adopt individuals of other races, particularly psionic ones such as elans, dromites, duergar, and maenads.</p><h3>Half-Giant Lands</h3><p>Half-giant families wander endlessly all over @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}, although they rarely stray into Riedran territory. There, they are often \"assimilated\"—a process beginning as slavery. What is remarkable is the degree to which they tend to coexist peaceably with denizens of all other regions. In Tashana, where families are known collectively as the Icebinders, half-giants have a long tradition of trade and cooperation with the shifter and human tribes. The Sandstrider families of Syrkarn keep more to themselves, with occasional but minimal conflict with the humans and eneko of the region.

But in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p><p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p><ul><li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes.

These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li><li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li></ul><h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3><p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p><p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs.

The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use. </p><h3>Talenta Halflings</h3><p>The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.</p><p>As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.</p><p>Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halfiings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur—like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs ofyour home remains strong.</p><p>Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration. </p><h3>Halflings of the Five Nations</h3><p>Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.</p><p>Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sham, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Stormreach]{Stormreach}. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point ofcontact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron.</p><h3>Halflings and Dragonmarks</h3><p>Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Mark of Healing}</em> in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda's} <em> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Mark of Hospitality}</em>.

Sometimes halflings of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}  joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire.

A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun. The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.</p><p>As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Darkvision]{Darkvision}:</span> Hobgoblin eyes are accustomed to the dark of Khyber.

Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.</p><h3>Bound to Spirits</h3><p>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature ofyour linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers.</p><h3>Hunted by Nightmares</h3><p>The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dominate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.</p><p>Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Dual Mind: </span>Because of the guidance from the quori spirit with which they are bonded, kalashtar begin play with a d6 @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Spirit} instead of a d4.

But in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p><p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p><ul><li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes.

These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li><li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li></ul><h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3><p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p><p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs.

While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.</p><h3>Living Steel and Stone</h3><p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge.

Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose—such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land—and embrace this task as they once did war.

Do you want to try a wily @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Wizard]{wizard}, a burly @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Barbarian]{barbarian}, a tricksy @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-edges.Rogue]{rogue}, or some original idea you’ve come up with yourself? The <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> rules allow you to create most anything.</p><p>For the world of <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>, take a close look at the Class Edges subsection in Setting Edges @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Setting Edges]{here}. These special abilities form the foundation of the typical player character types found in Eberron. Keep these in mind as you follow the rest of these steps so you can build toward those if you want to play a traditional Eberron-style hero.</p><h2>Species</h2><p>This core rule book comes with nineteen recommended species to use when creating player characters. See species for more info @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Ancestry]{here}.</p><h2>Hindrances</h2><p>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances} are flaws, drawbacks, or dark secrets drawn from a character’s backstory. They provide up to four additional “Hindrance points” you can use to enhance your hero during character creation.</p><p>Taking Hindrances not only helps you define and roleplay your hero, but also allows you to increase his @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{attribute or skill} points, take @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}, or have additional gold to buy better adventuring gear.</p><p>A Major @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Hindrances]{Hindrance} is worth 2 Hindrance points, and a Minor is worth 1. A hero could thus take two Major Hindrances, four Minor, or any combination that adds up to 4 character points. (You can take <em>more</em> Hindrances if you want but the maximum benefit is 4 points!)</p><p><strong>For 2 Hindrance points you can:</strong></p><ul class=\"bullet\"><li>Raise an attribute one die type, or</li><li>Choose an Edge</li></ul><p><strong>For 1 Hindrance point you can:</strong></p><ul class=\"bullet\"><li>Gain another skill point, or</li><li>Start play with an additional 600 gold pieces.</li></ul><h2>Traits</h2><p>Characters are defined by attributes and skills, collectively called “Traits.” Attributes and skills are ranked by die types, typically from d4 to d12, with d6 being the average for adult humans. Higher is better!</p><p>Attributes typically govern how fast your skills can increase, and are used for passive effects such as resisting spells or recovering from injuries.</p><h3>Attributes</h3><p>Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, and Vigor (discussed in more detail in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits}).</p><p>You then have 5 character points to increase your attributes. Raising a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point.</p><p><strong>Attribute Limit:</strong> No attribute may be raised above a d12 unless an ancestral ability or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edge} says otherwise. Each increase beyond a d12 adds a +1 modifier. Increasing a d12 Strength two steps or “die types,” for example, gives your hero a @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} score of d12+2.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Skills are learned abilities such as firing weapons, hand-to-hand combat, scientific knowledge, professional aptitudes, and so on.</p><p>Skills in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> are very broad to keep the action simple and straightforward. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Shooting]{Shooting} skill, for example, covers all types of bows and crossbows. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics} skill covers thrown weapons, as well as grappling, swimming, and climbing. Detailed customization comes in the form of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}.</p><p><strong>Core Skills:</strong> Five skills are marked with a red star in the list for skills in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits}: <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Athletics]{Athletics}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Common Knowledge]{Common Knowledge}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Persuasion]{Persuasion}</strong>, and <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Stealth]{Stealth}</strong>. These are “innate” abilities most adult adventurers have. Unless an ancestral ability, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edge}, or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Hindrances]{Hindrance} says otherwise, your character starts with a d4 in each of these five core skills.</p><p><strong>Buying Skills:</strong> After core skills are assigned, you have 12 additional character points to raise core skills or buy and raise new skills as you see fit.</p><p>Each die type costs 1 point (starting at d4) as long as the skill is equal to or less than the attribute it’s linked to (listed beside the skill in parentheses, in the list starting in the Skills subsection in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits}). If you exceed the linked attribute, the cost becomes 2 points per die type.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Your character starts with Common and knows additional languages equal to half her @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Smarts} die type. Typical choices are listed with each ancestry. See Languages in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Traits} for more information.</p><p><strong>Skill Limit:</strong> Skills may not be increased above d12 during character creation unless the character’s ancestry starts with the skill at d6. If the skill starts with a d6, increase her maximum to d12+1. Elves in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Ancestry]{Races} start with a d6 in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Notice]{Notice}, for example, which means their Notice skill may be increased to d12+1.</p><h3>Derived Statistics</h3><p>Your character sheet contains a few other statistics you need to fill in, described below.</p><p><strong>Pace</strong> is how fast your character moves in tactical situations like combat. Standard Pace is 6, which means six tabletop inches per game round. Each inch is two yards (6 feet) in the real world. <strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Movement]{Movement}</strong> is explained in detail in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Combat]{Combat}.</p><p><strong>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry}</strong> is equal to 2 plus half your character’s @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-skills.Fighting]{Fighting} die type (a total of 2 if a character doesn’t have Fighting), plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. This is the Target Number (TN) to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>For Fighting skills higher than d12, such as d12+1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded down. For instance, Fighting d12+1 grants a Parry of 8, while Fighting d12+2 results in a Parry of 9.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> A hero’s default @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Size and Scale]{Size} is 0 unless altered by ancestral abilities, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}, or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances}. It cannot be less than −1 or more than +3.</p><p><strong>Toughness</strong> is your hero’s damage thres­hold. Damage rolls that equal or exceed this number @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Applying Damage]{cause harm} (explained later in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Rules]{Rules}).</p><p>Toughness is 2 plus half your hero’s @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Vigor}, plus @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Armor]{Armor} (use the armor worn on his torso. Vigor over a d12 is calculated just like @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Parry]{Parry}, above.</p><h2>Edges</h2><p>Attributes and skills are a character’s basic statistics, but what really makes individuals different are their @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges}.</p><p>In <cite>Savage Eberron</cite>, every character starts with a Class Edge for free. The character must qualify for the Edge as usual. (If a player doesn’t want to take a Class Edge, she may take a free Background or Professional Edge she qualifies for instead.)</p><p>Characters get additional Edges by taking @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances}, from racial abilities (such as Humans’ Adaptability), or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Advancement]{Advances} once play begins.</p><p>A comprehensive list of Edges for use in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> is available @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{here}.</p><h2>Gear</h2><p>Player characters have 300 gold pieces (or “gp”) to purchase any of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.3 Personal Weapons]{weapons}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.2 Armor]{armor}, and adventuring gear presented in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Gear]{the Gear Chapter}.</p><p>This might represent everything the character owns or it may represent only “adventuring” gear, with the hero’s more mundane belongings stored at a home or elsewhere.</p><h2>Background</h2><img class=\"float-right\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/swpf-core-rules/assets/art/p18_Crafting_Spear_Maker.webp')\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f43f8ea1a91d63438d13159/artwork-savage-eberron/general/p18_Crafting_Spear_Maker.webp\" /><p>Finish your new hero by filling in any additional history or background you see fit. Ask yourself why she’s where she is and what her goals are. Where does she live? Does she have any close friends or family who might be relevant to the game? Why did she join the Pathfinders?</p><p>Or just start playing and fill in these details as they become important and you walk around in her shoes a bit.</p><p>You might also want to talk to the other players. Maybe your characters know each other right from the start. Or you might collectively decide to optimize your group a bit and ensure you’ve got a good assortment of skills and abilities. If so, make sure you’re playing what you want to play. There’s no point in being the party’s healer if that’s not a role you care to play.</p><h3>Deities and alignment</h3><p>The conflict between Good and Evil is a core theme of any <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> game. Typically, heroes fight for Good, but not always.</p><p>Alignments in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> indicate the general moral compass of a person, creature or organization. Where alignment is listed, it is a tool for the Dungeon Master to identify the broad outlook of that entity, and how it may interact with others, including the adventurers. When choosing an alignment for your character, you decide what ethical path he will follow, guided by the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges} and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrances} you chose to define him. Unless your DM specifically agrees, you cannot choose Evil as your alignment.</p><p>Some character concepts require choosing a deity or “Domain” that governs powers and certain abilities. Likewise, the player’s choice of Hindrances can involve a Deity or a cause, such as @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Vow]{Vow} or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Code of Honor]{Code of Honor}. Deities have a listed alignment, either Good, Neutral, or Evil to indicate the general philosophy of the deity and her followers. Of course, adherents to a particular faith might not necessarily share the same outlook as the deity's alignment. Terrible deeds might be perpetrated in the name of a good or merciful god. You can find more information on domains and deities in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges} section.</p><div><h1 class=\"wide\">Character Creation Summary</h1><h3>Concept</h3><ul class=\"bullet\"><li>Start with a general idea of what you want to play.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Known as <em>guul'dar</em>, or \"strong people\", among the <em>dar</em> or goblin races. <em>Guul'dar</em> are born for battle and mayhem being fierce and aggressive. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despite being bossed around. In Darguun they living in tribes in the Marguul mountains, or in the <em>ghaal'dur </em>tribes ruling Darguun often serving as shock troops being ruled by the hobgoblins with superior numbers and intellect.</p><h3>The Marguul</h3><p>The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the <em>ghaal'dar</em> long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.</p><p>As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-hindrances.Bloodthirsty]{Bloodthirsty}:</span> Bugbears are very brutal killers and like to inflict pain. </li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Brute Strength:</span> Bugbears are naturally strong, and start with a d6 in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Strength} instead of a d4.

This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.</p><h3>A Hidden People</h3><p>Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether their presence is known.</p><p>Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler.</p><p>In creating a changeling adventurer, consider the character's relationships with people around them. Does the character conceal their true changeling nature? Do they embrace it? Do they have connections to other changelings or are they alone and in search of companions?</p><h3>Masks and Personas</h3><p>In their true form, changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shapeone created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history-is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona with a history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p><p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on dutywill adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Change Appearance]{Change Appearance}:</span> Changelings can alter physical appearance at will as per the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Disguise]{disguise}</em> power except it cannot affect clothing or gear.

Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.</p><p>Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm belowwhich was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten. </p><h3>Dwarves of the Mror Holds</h3><p>The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions-strange symbiotic items that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.</p><p>Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element ofyour character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.</p><p>Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.</p><h3>Dwarves of the Five Nations</h3><p>Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes-and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sharn]{Sharn} or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Thrane]{Thrane} more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.</p><p>When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?</p><h3>Dwarves and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Mark of Warding} </em>appears on dwarves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak}, which had its origins as one of the clans of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}. @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{Kundarak} dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.</p><p>In addition to providing all manner of security, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Kundarak]{House Kundarak} dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-special-abilities.Dwarven Resilience]{Dwarven Resilience}:</span> Dwarves are hardy and resistant to toxins.

This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow-assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} and settled the island nation of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.</p><p>Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Elf, Drow]{drow}, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.</p><p>As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship wit.h the past: Do you value the traditions ofyour ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?</p><h3>Elves of the Five Nations</h3><p>Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there.</p><p>As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions ofyour ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.</p><p>Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?</p><h3>Elves and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadow}</em> first appeared among the elves of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Phiarlan} line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Thuranni]{House Thuranni}. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.</p><p>Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Phiarlan]{Mark of Shadow} </em>appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Bladesan espionage agency in the service of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}'s Sibling Kings.</p><h3>Aereni and Tairnadal</h3><p>For thousands of years, the island nation of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.</p><p>Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars-against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Agile or Intelligence:</span> Tairnadal Elves tend to be graceful and agile, while Aereni elves tend to be highly intelligent.

Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living descendants about these shadows of the distant past.</p><p>When the elves fled to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal}, the drow remained on @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} as subjects of the giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger on @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.</p><p>Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.</p><h3>A Drow Adventurer</h3><p>When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?</p><p>How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust.

Also known as \"mongrel ogres\", eneko are a true breeding race in their own right with a long and rich cultural heritage.</p><h3>Free People</h3><p>The home of the eneko, Syrkarn, is a sanctuary of freedom, diversity and humility built out of yuan-ti ruins by refugees fleeing the monolithic culture and military of Riedra. Eneko and humans equally make up the vast majority of the loose nation's inhabitants, and the philosophy of the eneko is difficult to separate from the region they call home.

Grandiose eneko may claim that the blood of the ancient human sorcerer kings and the mightiest titans of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} flows through their veins. While many Riedrans deride the eneko, labelling them \"mongrels\", eneko themselves view the diversity of their heritage as one of their greatest strengths.</p><h3>Dark Magic</h3><p>The arcane power displayed by their legendary forebearers leads many eneko to the study of magic. The cult of Karrak the Final Guardian, a deity sometimes called an aspect of the Keeper, is said to have its origins in the giants of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}.

Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.</p><h3>Gnomes of Zilargo</h3><p>To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some ofwhich persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals-of which there are many-often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.</p><p>Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.</p><p>When you're making a Zil gnome character, consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.</p><p>Additionally, consider your relationship to @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}: why you have left, and what ties do you still have to it? Your scheme could provide a good reason for you to leave. Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories ofyour adventures back to the Korranberg Chronicle. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}. Ifyou are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent-gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.</p><p><strong>Zil Names. </strong>Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.</p><h3>Gnomes of the Five Nations</h3><p>As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.</p><p>As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.</p><h3>Gnomes and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{Mark of Scribing}</em> appears among the gnomes of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Sivis]{House Sivis}. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo} and live in human lands.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Amongst the most areas of Khorvaire goblins are at best second class citizens that are often nothing more than scavengers. Among the <em>dar</em> or goblinoid races, goblins are known as the <em>golin'dar</em>, the \"quick people\", known as crafters, skilled labor, and excellent scouts. Not knowing any better, when humans came to Khorvaire they named the goblinoid people after the most prolific breeders, goblins.</p><h3>City Goblins</h3><p>Goblins dwell in most o f the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} during the Last War.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the <em>ghaal'dar</em>; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Agile:</span> Goblins are naturally quick and agile.

New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term \"half-elf,\" instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning \"children of Khorvaire.\"</p><p>The elves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.</p><p>In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?</p><h3>Khorvar</h3><p>The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.</p><p>Many Khoravar espouse the idea of \"the bridge between,\" the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.</p><p>Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.</p><p>As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide inspiration for it.</p><h3>Half-evles and Dragonmarks</h3><p>Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{Mark of Detection} </em>is found in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Medani]{House Medani} and the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{Mark of Storm} </em>in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Lyrandar]{House Lyrandar}.

Half-giants refer to their groups as families, rather than tribes or clans, although few members of a family are actually blood-related.

In Tashana, where families are known collectively as the Icebinders, half-giants have a long tradition of trade and cooperation with the shifter and human tribes. The Sandstrider families of Syrkarn keep more to themselves, with occasional but minimal conflict with the humans and eneko of the region.

The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use. </p><h3>Talenta Halflings</h3><p>The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.</p><p>As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.</p><p>Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halfiings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur—like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs ofyour home remains strong.</p><p>Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration. </p><h3>Halflings of the Five Nations</h3><p>Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.</p><p>Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sham, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Stormreach]{Stormreach}. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point ofcontact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron.</p><h3>Halflings and Dragonmarks</h3><p>Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Mark of Healing}</em> in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda's} <em> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Mark of Hospitality}</em>. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Aerenal]{Aerenal} received their first marks—centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda}  joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.</p><p>With its powers related to food and shelter, the <em> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{Mark of Hospitality}</em> was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Ghallanda]{House Ghallanda} to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the <em> @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{Mark of Healing}</em> has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Jorasco]{House Jorasco} still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Athletic: </span>Halflings are nimble beings.

It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.</p><p>Among the <em>dar</em> or goblin people, hobgoblins are known as <em>ghaal'dar</em> or \"mighty people\". Hobgoblins are the most organized and intelligent of the goblinoid species, often holding the positions of power and organization.</p><h3>The Ghaal'dar</h3><p>The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun. The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.</p><p>As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.</p><h3>The Heirs of Dhakaan</h3><p>Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds ofcorruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.</p><p>The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.</p><p>The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh'dar (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.</p><p>As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile?

Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.</p><h3>Bound to Spirits</h3><p>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature ofyour linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers.</p><h3>Hunted by Nightmares</h3><p>The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dominate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.</p><p>Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark.

With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p><p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p><ul><li>The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the \"binding flame\"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call ofKalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.</li><li>The Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li><li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li></ul><h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3><p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p><p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal numbers.</p><p>When playing an orc or half-orc character from the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, consider what circumstances brought you into the wider world. The Leaving the Shadow Marches table offers some inspiration.</p><h3>Half-orcs and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The <em>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{Mark of Finding}</em> appears among orcs of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.House Tharashk]{House Tharashk}.

Such tieflings are touched by the fiendish forces bound beneath the Wastes, and the tribes consider them to be blessed. If you're playing such a tiefling, why have you left the Wastes? It could be that you were destined for some evil purpose-perhaps even serving as an avatar for an imprisoned Overlord-and you are fleeing that destiny.</p><p>Other tieflings are shaped not by fiendish powers, but by the influence of the fiend-tainted planes. Such tieflings might be born in manifest zones, where a plane exerts influence over a region. Planar tieflings are oddities, often seen as strange but not necessarily evil.</p><p>Finally, the Venomous Demesne—a city-state hidden on the far side of Droaam—is populated by tieflings.

The Venomous Demesne has had no significant contact with the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and few know it exists. Your character could be an envoy or exile from it, or simply an adventurer driven by a desire to see what lies beyond your homeland.</p><h3>Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h3><p>Tieflings rarely appear in the cities and towns of Khorvaire, with most dwelling at the fringes of civilization. Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.</p><p>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them.

While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.</p><h3>Living Steel and Stone</h3><p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.</p><p>Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids. </p><h3>Warforged Personality</h3><p>The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.</p><p>The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose—such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land—and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.</p><p>The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity.</p><p>The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.</p><h3>Racial Abilities</h3><ul class=\"red-bullet-list\"><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Built for War:</span> Warforged were designed, built, and trained as tools of war.

Legendary characters may raise an attribute no more than every fourth Advance, up to the ancestral or class maximum.</li><li><p><span class=\"list-heading\">Skills:</span> Increase a skill that is equal to or greater than its linked attribute one die type;<br />OR increase two skills that are lower than their linked attributes by one die type each (including new skills the character didn’t have before at d4). You cannot increase the same skill twice with the same Advance.</p></li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Edge:</span> Gain a new Edge. You should have a story-based reason to take a Background or a core @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Setting Edges]{Class Edge}. You can’t become a barbarian overnight, after all. Gaining these @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.6 Edges]{Edges} should usually take years or some dramatic change in the character’s life, and should only be done with the Dungeon Master’s permission. Core Class Edges and core @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.7 Setting Edges]{Prestige Edges} are also limited to one per Rank. Legendary characters may choose a core Class Edge (or Prestige Edge) no more than every fourth Advance.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Buy Off a Hindrance:</span> Permanently remove a Minor @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Hindrances]{Hindrance}, or reduce a Major Hindrance to a Minor (if possible). The player and DM should work out how and when this happens. Perhaps the shocking death of an ally triggers a change in attitude, the hero puts real effort into improving harmful behavior, or seeks professional help during @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Downtime]{Downtime}.</li></ul><h2>Rank</h2><p>“Ranks” reflect a character’s competence and experience. They provide balance between players and grant access to more powerful abilities as one “Advances.” A character begins at Novice Rank and works upward from there. Advances are given out after one or more game sessions. The DM has more detailed information in the Advancement section @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Advancement]{here}.</p><p>Only player characters use Ranks— Dungeon Master-controlled characters and creatures don’t (we’ll tell you more about this later).</p><table><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"2\">Rank</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading centered\">Advances</th><th class=\"sub-heading centered\">Rank</th></tr><tr><td class=\"centered\">0–3</td><td class=\"centered\">Novice</td></tr><tr><td class=\"centered\">4–7</td><td class=\"centered\">Seasoned</td></tr><tr><td class=\"centered\">8–11</td><td class=\"centered\">Veteran</td></tr><tr><td class=\"centered\">12–15</td><td class=\"centered\">Heroic</td></tr><tr><td class=\"centered\">16+</td><td class=\"centered\">Legendary</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Starting With Experienced Characters</h3><p>If the Dungeon Master wants to start a game with more experienced characters, or you're making a replacement for a fallen hero, you should still make a Novice starting profile and @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Advancement]{Advance} it from there. This ensures characters are balanced just as if they had gained experience normally.</p><p>Additional goods, equipment, or other assets must be determined by the Dungeon Master. As a quick rule of thumb, Seasoned heroes have 10,000 gold pieces worth of goods and magic items, Veteran characters get 40,000, Heroic 150,000, and Legendary 500,000.</p><h2>Advancement Pace</h2><p>How fast characters Advance in <cite>Savage Eberron</cite> depends on the campaign.</p><ul><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Official Adventure Paths:</span> These epic tales tell the Dungeon Master when to give the party an Advance. They typically start at Novice Rank and end at Legendary+, spreading improvements along as the story advances to different stages.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Short Campaigns:</span> If you’re running a campaign of your own creation and expect it to last 10 sessions or less, we recommend giving characters an Advance after each session.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Long Campaigns:</span> Grant an Advance after every two or three sessions for a long campaign, slowing it down to every four or five sessions once the heroes hit Heroic Rank.</li><li><span class=\"list-heading\">Milestone Campaigns:</span> Grant an Advance after certain objectives are met in the campaign. You can grant Advances a bit more often in the early stages, slowing things down in the middle and later chapters.</li></ul><h2>Allies &amp; Advancement</h2><p>Followers and other allies who stay with the party for extended periods can improve their abilities as well.</p><p>If the party advances and the Dungeon Master feels the allies have played a significant role in the story, they Advance as well. This gives player characters a group of loyal retainers and hirelings to interact with and deepens immersion.</p><p>You’ll find an Ally Sheet on our website the group can fill in and use to keep up with their retainers' profile, gear, history, and other notes.</p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"Langauges","type":"text","_id":"GExl4xVmMPGHeLpt","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"sweb-core\"><h1 class=\"wide\">Languages</h1><p>In Eberron, languages reflect culture and geography; a dwarf raised in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Breland]{Breland} might not know Dwarvish, but a halfling raised in the Mror Holds might. The historical development of languages and cultures also explains the scripts used to write various languages. For example, the Orc language is written using the Goblin script, because the orcs of Khorvaire learned writing from the goblins. Common is the language of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Five Nations]{Five Nations} and the language of trade in Khorvaire, known by most of its people. Goblin was the trade language of the goblin empire of Dhakaan and survives as the primary language in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, and the Shadow Marches. Goblin displaced the Orc language; the people of the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches} typically speak Goblin, and Orc is an exotic language. Members of all races in @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik} speak Giant and use it as their trade language. Infernal is the common tongue of all fiends, while Celestial is \"the tongue of Siberys.\"</p><h2>Welcome to Eberron</h2><p>With the DM's approval, you can exchange a language granted by your race for a different language from the Standard Languages of Eberron table. If your halfling was raised in the @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}, you might replace Halfling with Dwarvish to reflect that background. The DM may change the languages assigned to a monster or NPC. An ogre from @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam} likely speaks Goblin instead of Giant.</p><table><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"3\">Standard Languages</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Language</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Typical Speakers</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Script</th></tr><tr><td>Common</td><td>Citizens of Khorvaire</td><td>Common</td></tr><tr><td>Dwarven</td><td>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Mror Holds]{Mror Holds}</td><td>Dwarvish</td></tr><tr><td>Elven</td><td>Aerenal, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Valenar]{Valenar}</td><td>Sylvan</td></tr><tr><td>Goblin</td><td>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Darguun]{Darguun}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Droaam]{Droaam}, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Shadow Marches]{Shadow Marches}, monsters of Khorvaire</td><td>Goblin</td></tr><tr><td>Gnomish</td><td>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Zilargo]{Zilargo}</td><td>Dwarvish</td></tr><tr><td>Halfling</td><td>@Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Talenta Plains]{Talenta Plains}</td><td>Goblin</td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"3\">Exotic Languages</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Language</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Typical Speakers</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Script</th></tr><tr><td>Argon</td><td>Barbarians of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Argonnessen]{Argonnessen} and Seren</td><td>Common</td></tr><tr><td>Draconic</td><td>Kobolds, lizardfolk, troglodytes, dragons, arcane uses</td><td>Draconic</td></tr><tr><td>Druidic</td><td>Druids, @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Eldeen Reaches]{Eldeen Reaches}</td><td>Draconic</td></tr><tr><td>Giant</td><td>Native inhabitants of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Xen'drik]{Xen'drik}</td><td>Giant</td></tr><tr><td>Orc</td><td>Isolated orc tribes</td><td>Goblin</td></tr><tr><td>Riedran</td><td>People of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.Sarlona]{Sarlona}</td><td>Common</td></tr><tr><td>Sahuagin</td><td>Sahuagin, sailors</td><td>Sahuagin</td></tr><tr><td>Khyber's Tongue</td><td>Denizens of Khyber, symbionts</td><td>Daelkyr</td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><th class=\"main-heading\" colspan=\"3\">Planar Languages</th></tr><tr><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Language</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Typical Speakers</th><th class=\"sub-heading left\">Script</th></tr><tr><td>Celestial</td><td>Celestials, Archons of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.KI8pzxk9wb1N1r9O]{Shavarath}, couatl, shulassukar</td><td>Celestial</td></tr><tr><td>Daan</td><td>lawful outsiders of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.BhzXimkcRrlZPjsc]{Daanvi}</td><td>Daan</td></tr><tr><td>Infernal</td><td>Beings of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.KI8pzxk9wb1N1r9O]{Shavarath}, Lords of Dust, tieflings</td><td>Infernal</td></tr><tr><td>Irial</td><td>Deathless, energy beings of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.7tUjCpjC6Nugn3ff]{Irian}</td><td>Celestial</td></tr><tr><td>Kythric</td><td>Slaadi, choatic outsiders of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.pgs12ipPyYbHRfhh]{Kythri}</td><td>Daan</td></tr><tr><td>Quori</td><td>Inspired, kalashtar, quori</td><td>Quori</td></tr><tr><td>Primordial</td><td>Elementals</td><td>Primordial</td></tr><tr><td>Sylvan</td><td>Dryads, eladrin, fey of @Compendium[sweb-core-rules.savage-eberron-lore.8Qr41zEq2UorAcce]{Thelanis} and woodland beings</td><td>Sylvan</td></tr></tbody></table></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"swade","systemVersion":"2.1.7","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674589342974,"modifiedTime":1674589491569,"lastModifiedBy":"7YwiyXiAhNBZZlLf"},"_id":"F3QL0OVOOYJiYIoO","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"7YwiyXiAhNBZZlLf":3}}
