(Power Points are listed for that purpose&mdash;it can never be cast without ritual magic.)</p>\n<p>If successful, he&rsquo;s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.tGBCnKkDi55VRxgm]{Exhausted} for the next five days but some version of the desired effect, narrated by the Dungeon Master as she sees fit, happens with a great display of magical energy.</p>\n<p>If the ritual&rsquo;s @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.712V5zxIGyc8K10r]{Dramatic Task} fails, the caster is @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.tGBCnKkDi55VRxgm]{Exhausted} as above and may not attempt the ritual again for five days or until some narrative goal is met (finding rare replacement components, the conjunction of the moons, or whatever the DM feels is appropriate). A @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.hCxcCUCRxHOWcNGS]{Critical Failure} also causes 5d6 damage in a 20&rdquo; (40 yard) radius as well.</p>\n<p><em>Mystic intervention</em> should give the heroes respite from major events but shouldn&rsquo;t short circuit the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s entire campaign. For example it may not slay a powerful foe outright, but may provide a weapon that aids in the fight against it. Or a besieging army might be swept away by a great flood&mdash;but another approaches in a month. The city of a great enemy might be leveled by an earthquake, but the citizens begin to rebuild mere hours afterwards.</p>\n<p>Finally, the power can&rsquo;t override free will. It can&rsquo;t make a good person evil, fall in love with someone they&rsquo;re not, or otherwise change their nature. It might give an individual new perspective or a moment of empathy somehow, but true change is always a choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Helpful Links:</strong> @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{Powers} - @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.4 Power Modifiers]{Power Modifiers}</p>\n</div>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"actions":{"skill":"","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"bonusDamageDie":6,"favorite":false,"templates":{"cone":false,"stream":false,"small":false,"medium":false,"large":false},"rank":"Legnedary","pp":"20","damage":"","range":"Special","duration":"Special","trapping":"Prayer, rituals, sacrifices, special artifacts or relics.","arcane":"","ap":0,"modifiers":[],"skill":"","source":"Fantasy Companion"},"_stats":{"systemId":"swade","systemVersion":"2.1.7","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674268711015,"modifiedTime":1674268711015,"lastModifiedBy":"7YwiyXiAhNBZZlLf"},"_id":"6Uc9jO8l7jzEZoP8","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"7YwiyXiAhNBZZlLf":3}}

She must know about the creature somehow, perhaps by previous encounter, access to strange books and scrolls, or an Occult roll with a bonus or penalty set by the Dungeon Master depending on the creature. The summoner can even summon a specific entity if she knows its proper name.</p>\n<p>Casting is an @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{opposed roll} between the summoner's @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} and the entity's @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Spirit}.

An evil being might ask for time to wander the earth and wreak havoc, a sacrifice, or some other \"devil's bargain\" proportional to the service required. A good or noble creature might aid the summoner without reward if the cause is just, or might require she perform some task for her followers or sphere of influence. Entities never agree to services they can't perform or that will clearly result in their destruction.</p>\n<p>Once the creature agrees to the terms, it must carry them out to the best of its ability. The caster does not have to live up to any promises she set&mdash;though entities might seek revenge if deceived or their kind are summoned too often. Casters must be wary of this, especially if the beings have a way back to the prime material plane!</p>\n<p><strong>Breaking Free:</strong> If no agreement is made after 24 hours, the caster must renew the mystic bonds by making another @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{opposed roll} of her @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} versus the creature's @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Spirit}.

It is taxing to alter reality, however, so the caster must permanently sacrifice 3 of his own Power Points (after the spell is cast). A raise on the @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.1 Powers]{arcane skill} roll eliminates this cost.</p>\n<p>A caster may wish for any one of the following effects per casting, chosen before the roll is made:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Activate a Power:</strong> Wish casts any other available power, including modifiers, available in the campaign with a raise. If the spell is @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Trait Rolls]{opposed}, the target rolls with a &minus;2 penalty on top of any other modifiers. If the Power Points required to activate the power and modifiers are greater than the cost of wish, the caster must pay the difference.</li>\n<li><strong>Intercession:</strong> The caster wishes for some form of aid, which typically appears after a short period of time. A party trapped in a collapsed dungeon might wish for escape only to be rescued by a party of dwarven miners. A spellcaster could wish to know the true name of a powerful demon and be contacted the next day by a traitorous subordinate of the creature.</li>\n<li><strong>Gain an Edge:</strong> The caster can gain (or grant another) a permanent Edge. The recipient must meet the Edge's Requirements and can never gain more than one Edge from a wish.</li>\n<li><strong>Wealth:</strong> The spellcaster wishes for up to 10,000 gp worth of goods, including anything from transportation to supplies to magic items. Such goods generally sell for a quarter of their value. The wealth doesn't appear from nothing but rather comes to the caster via events contrived by the DM.</li>\n<li><strong>Travel Back Through Time:</strong> The caster travels back in time for a short period: one minute outside of combat or back to the start of the current round in combat. Everything that happened in that period is reversed except for the caster's Power Points, Bennies, and Wounds.\n<p>The DM should do her best to remember all other actors' state of things from the start of the round, but warping time is imperfect so don't worry about getting everything exactly right.</p>\n<p>Once reversed, only the caster remembers the alternate sequence of events, and that period of time cannot be altered again.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>See the Future:</strong> The caster peers into the near or far future. A look into the near future grants her three Conviction tokens that must be used by the caster or anyone she's currently in contact with (mental, verbal, in sight, etc.) within the next five rounds. At the end of the fifth round, any remaining tokens are discarded. A look into the far future allows the caster to ask the Dungeon Master one question about the future and receive as accurate an answer as possible. Actions by the spellcaster can change the future, however, so this may only be the most likely path or a warning of future dangers.</li>\n<li><strong>Raise a Trait:</strong> Wish can permanently increase a Trait one die type. This increases the Trait's limit by one die type as well. A recipient may never have more than one Trait raised by a wish.</li>\n<li><strong>Restore Fate:</strong> The hero and all Wild Cards in Range may refill their @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.Bennies]{Bennies} to their usual starting maximum.</li>\n<li><strong>Special:</strong> The character may change relatively minor aspects of herself, others, or the world around her (if the subject of the wish doesn't want to be affected, it's resisted with a @Compendium[savage-eberron-rules.savage-eberron-rules.5 Traits]{Spirit} roll at &minus;2). This shouldn't cause any far-reaching changes to the world or history, shouldn't be covered by one of the abilities above, and is completely at the whim of the Dungeon Master. A caster can change her gender, ancestry, languages, etc., but these changes do not alter time and are thus not retroactive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wish can improve someone's mood (and their attitude on the Reaction Table, if appropriate), but it can't permanently affect free will.
